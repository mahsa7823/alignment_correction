-- basically , it was unanimously agreed upon by the various relevant parties .
To express its determination , the Chinese securities regulatory department compares this stock reform to a die that has been cast .
It takes time to prove whether the stock reform can really meet expectations , and whether any deviations that arise during the stock reform can be promptly corrected .
Dear viewers , the China News program will end here . This is Xu Li .
Hello , dear viewers . Welcome to Focus Today .
Before dawn on January 3 , a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of Jingguang Bridge , East Third Ring Road , Beijing Municipality , resulting in the road caving in .
Relevant departments from Beijing Municipality promptly activated emergency contingency plans .
The traffic administration department carried out traffic supervision near the accident scene .
Well , how did the emergency response mechanisms activated by governmental departments operate effectively during the holiday ?
In addition , what measures did relevant departments take to resolve issues such as waste discharge , heating , and communication , in order to ensure that the lives of citizens were not affected ?
Well , we have invited two honorable guests to the studio today to follow this topic with us .
Next is Yang Yang , a host of Beijing Traffic Radio Station .
Welcome both of you to the studio to participate in our program .
Well , I especially want to know , ha , how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident ?
Ah , at 11:00 a.m. , about 11:00 m. yesterday , ah , I happened to find out through an SMS when I was outside .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
It happened that I was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at noon .
And you , Yang Yang ?
A friend happened to call me .
You were not at work that day ?
Right , right , right .
Uh-huh .
Well , like Professor Zhou , I also received this news , ha , through a mobile phone SMS .
At that time , I , it can be said that this SMS was among the many , ha , SMS containing New Year wishes , like Happy New Year , received after the start of the New Year .
Uh-huh .
Ah , actually I felt a lot of warmth when I received that SMS .
Yes , exceptionally .
Some car owners said that it was very good that the SMS was sent .
Furthermore , there was one last sentence in that SMS thanking citizens for their cooperation and support .
Uh-huh .
Of course , in private life , people have used SMS countless times to spread news .
Yes .
Other places in the country must have used this too .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Must have used this too .
Actually , I remember receiving an SMS like this one last year before it snowed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in Beijing to a rather large extent .
Uh-huh .
However , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time .
Uh-huh .
Ah , when an SMS is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?
Uh-huh .
For instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone SMS .
We usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .
Yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the Internet .
Right .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , this time I think that a short SMS like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form .
Uh-huh .
Yes .
We drive often in Beijing , ha , Yang Yang .
Furthermore , I think that when SMS was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our China very well .
Why is that so ?
This is because , it should be said that China is the country with the highest SMS usage .
There are probably not as many chances to use SMS in foreign countries compared with domestically , in China , ah .
So , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement .
Yes , I noticed that many friends around me , around me received it . It seems that almost everyone received this SMS .
Yes .
Yes .
Have you received information like this before ?
No , no . This was the first time .
The first time ?
Yes , yes .
Well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ?
Really quite fast , ah .
So , I did not drive today . I set out a bit earlier and took the subway here .
Do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ?
Ah , the response was quite fast .
In addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt .
Colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and SMS .
Well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression .
Well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes .
Well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road .
All personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations .
See , through this footage , we see , ah , this --
Uh-huh .
That means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred .
Well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .
A special program .
Yes , a special program on this traffic .
Previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in Beijing .
That is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the Jingguang Bridge of the Third Ring Road , it might cause the entire Third Ring Road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods .
Uh-huh .
It might even impact traffic on the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road .
Well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from Jingguang Bridge to Changhong Bridge from the south all the way to Guomao Bridge , blocking the main and side roads .
Well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone .
Hence , at that time , before 6:30 a .m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried .
Uh-huh .
However , the affected area was not as large as expected .
Moreover , some people made detours once they received the news .
Right .
Psychologically , people felt quite relieved .
Because I know this situation .
That person did not even drive .
Right . Actually , in this aspect , I think that citizens were really quite cooperative .
For instance , this evening , we had a , received an SMS .
A friend said , I work on the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge , ah .
We were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .
Later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the China World Trade Center .
Right .
This road represents a main road on East Third Ring Road , with problems on both the main and side roads .
Furthermore , Chaoyang Road is an intersection .
Uh-huh .
Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .
Well , Chaoyang Road is a very important artery in the east - west direction .
Yes . When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .
Hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .
Yes . As buses that cross the Third Ring Road are currently , right now affected by the Jingguang Bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted .
Uh-huh .
Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .
It is really like this , just look at the bus signs .
Right .
Have not seen so many buses . Right .
Yes . When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .
Uh-huh .
Well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ?
Our correspondent specially interviewed Director Meng Xianlong , Mr. Meng Xianlong , of the Command Center of the Beijing Municipal Traffic Administration .
Um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan .
In the roads close to where the problem emerged , we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends .
In this way , all vehicles going along East Third Ring Road had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides .
In order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district , we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans .
We set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along East Second Ring Road , East Fourth Ring Road , West Dawang Road , ah , and related roads to the east and west , and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic .
It can be said that measures were very promptly taken .
Ah , today is the first workday after the New Year holiday .
Well , what exactly was the situation this morning ? We specially sent a reporter to the scene this morning to shoot some footage .
Well , from this footage , we can see that , ha , at East Third Ring Road , ah , near Guanghua Bridge , the roads here that lead to the vicinity of Jingguang Bridge have come under control and , well , various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations .
Although the outdoor temperature in Beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making detours .
Well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly .
Uh-huh .
Right , right .
You , through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?
Actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS .
Therefore , they sent SMS saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus .
Well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning .
We then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .
This shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind .
I think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mentality that Beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations .
That is , they think that the government has tried its best .
Well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts .
Uh-huh .
That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .
We know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed .
Time was lost .
Well , yes , the State Council has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms .
That is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do .
In this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed .
However , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects .
Yes .
Right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground . They include those like you just mentioned , as well as pipes like those for heating and communication , among others .
Truly , these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens .
Closely linked .
It is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .
How many groups of people will be sent ? Many groups .
Yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .
It is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .
Uh-huh .
How can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?
Well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .
For instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .
However , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by Beijing Municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .
Uh-huh .
It was a very successful , er , response .
For instance , it is very cold during winter in Beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently .
Er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .
Well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing .
Well , in this , in this regard , the Chaoyang district government did a very good job .
After it received from the municipal government , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent electric heat , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .
It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .
Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Professor Zhou , actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .
For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .
Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .
This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .
It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .
Yes .
Yes .
Right .
It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .
Yes .
Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .
It is because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing .
Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening .
Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .
Ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .
It was not clear , it was very congested . You sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .
You could find out other news only by telephone . The various methods and channels were extremely unclear .
Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .
Yes .
It should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .
This is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .
Early warnings and forecasts .
Yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism .
Uh-huh .
It is not only for this , this , ah , this , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
In fact , there are , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .
For instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .
We have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others .
That is to say , we have many corresponding systems .
Um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?
For instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .
With a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?
How can a safe , assured system be established ?
Well , we need to learn and manage this .
Uh-huh .
For instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast .
Well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .
Well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?
Well , how will they go undergo testing ? These also include some of our command and policy - making systems .
That is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities .
How can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?
%pw The State Council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called One Plan , Three Systems .
Uh-huh .
Traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now . Well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes .
Well , Yang Yang , based on your understanding , how long will it take ?
Therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress . This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone .
Uh-huh .
This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone . There is also an issue with many of the pipes below .
Yes , the pipes below .
Right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --
Yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster has already been added , has already been added .
But in the end , it requires time . Hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature .
Um , and , for instance , optical fibers , ah .
Er , right now , if the optical fibers break , people in many households will not be able to watch television .
after that , yes , these were not damaged .
they were not damaged and this is quite normal .
Um , there is no problem with water supply .
Okay , well , today both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave - in accident in Beijing Municipality .
Okay , thank you very much , Professor Zhou and Yang Yang , for coming to the studio to participate in our program .
See you at the same time tomorrow .
We see that except for some areas of South China , Southwest China , and Northeast China , many other places will be experiencing temperature drops .
In addition , there will be snowfall in the area from Northwest China to the Huang - Huai area through southern North China .
The east of Southwest China , as well as the Jiang - Huai area and the area south of the Yangtze River , will experience continuous rainfall .
However , southern North China and the Huang - Huai area will bid farewell to the snow tonight , ah .
In addition , there will be rain throughout almost the whole of South China .
It can be said that there will be less snow in the north and heavier rain in the south tomorrow .
Furthermore , temperatures tomorrow in many places south of the Huai River will fall by between four and ten degrees .
He said , on the contrary , that China , under the premise of strengthening its financial risk prevention and control , will increase capital utilization benefits and support developing State - owned enterprise as targets , adhere to not changing reforms utilizing foreign capital , and at the same time will suitably re-adjust and perfect the policies of utilizing foreign capital .
Besides insisting that financial institutions be the main foreign financing channels , there will be a few special large - scale state - owned enterprises with good international reputations , with high standards of multinational operations , that have good asset - to - debt ratios , and good benefits , that enter the international capital market to implement debt issuance .
After three years of experimentation , issuance methods and features of transferable bonds are accepted domestically . Henceforth , the main lending bodies will optimize financing structures according to their characteristics and market demand , in making choices in areas such as transferrable bonds , bonds and bank loans , and will systematically develop issuance of project financing bonds , ABS , etc. , that have no recall or limited recall rights , thereby reducing the pressure of financial institutions in foreign lending and promoting project management to become international , to become scientific , and to become transparent .
In short , we will actively utilize every type of financing method with international benefits , reduce costs of our overall financing and reduce our financial risks .
According to presentations , it has been 15 years now since 1982 , when China first issued overseas debt .

Recently , related experts and scholars discovered a large quantity of dinosaur bones fossils in Yangcheng Township , Xixia County of Henan Province .
This is another big discovery coming after an abundance of precious dinosaur eggs fossils were discovered here at the beginning of last year .
This reporter has learnt from the Archaeological Institute of Cultural Relics that at the beginning of April of this year , related experts discovered several hundred dinosaur bone fossils , including ribs , phalanges , etc. , between two river gravel layers at such places as Hutou Hill , Yangcheng Township , Xixia county , etc .
From the view of stratigraphy , they all belong to the Cretaceous period .
They believe that the discovery of a large quantity of valuable dinosaur eggs fossils in the Xixia basin is an international rarity , and egg fossils and bone fossils existing in one place is even rarer .
The discovery of the dinosaur bone fossils also provides important clues about the region and burial patterns for further searching for dinosaur fossils .

To investigate this , Xu Xin would listen to the comments from his competitors and would observe his assistant .
In the face of criticism and nitpicking , I believe that Jesus is weaker than Darwin .
Why ?
But as the originator , Darwin deserves much credit .
Therefore , if you find a sentence that is allegedly said by God , but effectively turns out to be wrong , then this god will be overthrown .
Therefore , Jesus is more vulnerable to criticism than Darwin , because once an error is found , then he could not be the true god .
