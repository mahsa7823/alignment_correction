A British newspaper revealed that the US had planned to bomb the al - Jazeera TV station in Qatar .
Was this a joke told by US President Bush or was it a long - meditated threat ?
Did British Prime Minister Blair know nothing about it , or did he succeed in persuading his ally to give up the idea of attacks ?
What exactly is the truth ?
Why can a TV station in a small Arab country have US President Bush on pins and needles ?
Hello , dear viewers , welcome to Focus Today .
On November 22 , the British newspaper Daily Mirror revealed that US President Bush once planned to bomb the al - Jazeera TV station headquarters , setting off a mighty uproar .
The two British nationals charged with leaking the information already appeared in court for interrogation yesterday for the first time .
According to a report by the British newspaper the Guardian , al - Jazeera TV station is now considering suing US President Bush for this matter .
Well , what exactly was this incident ?
One is Mr. Ruan Zongze , vice director of the China Institute of International Studies . Mr. Ruan Zongze has done extensive researches on British and US issues .
The other is Mr. Wu Huixuan , former CIR chief correspondent based in Qatar .
Hello ! Welcome you two to the studio for our interview .
We will first talk about the Daily Mirror article that started it .
What we are seeing now on screen is a very popular newspaper in Britain called the Daily Mirror .
The title goes like this :
The article writes that the minutes of a meeting between British Prime Minister Blair , who was visiting the US on April 16 , 2004 , and US President Bush at the White House showed that Bush had intended to take military actions against al - Jazeera TV station headquartered in the Qatari capital of Doha .
Then , Blair said to Bush that such an action would trigger a worldwide uproar .
These are some records of the conversation between the two men .
And equally without doubt , Blair did not want him , that is , Bush , to do this .
So what we are seeing on screen was exactly transmitted by al - Jazeera TV station .
Well , yesterday the two British nationals involved in the disclosure of the incident were interrogated by the court . Well , here is the scene of the two persons under interrogation .
In the meantime , al - Jazeera TV station also protested several times upon learning the information .
Well , regarding this topic , the first question today is that we want to find out clearly whether this incident was real or not .
Well , Director Yuan , I know that you also once worked in Britain . Well , what kind of newspaper is the Daily Mirror ?
It is said to have a very large circulation , but people still call it a tabloid . So how accurate is the news carried by it ?
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
That is why it is called a tabloid , because it does not belong to the mainstream in the current British newspaper industry .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Right , they have a fairly steady readership .
Right .
Well , this newspaper is said to have various kinds of topics appropriate to all ages .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Well , so , now we need to seriously consider its authenticity or accuracy .
Is the news carried by it credible or not ?
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
However , when the news was released , it set off such a mighty uproar .
Uh-huh .
This is the first point .
The second point is to look at the reaction of al - Jazeera TV station . What al - Jazeera TV station is now asking Britain to do is to either confirm the news as true or to deny it .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
It did not confirm anything .
Could this be used to determine that there was indeed such an incident ?
There was such an incident , um , uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Regarding the leakage of the secret , it seems that the possibility here , ah , is really big .
Um .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
So , well , these two people have already been suspected of violating this section , and that is why they have been sued .
Right .
Well , of course it is still in a preliminary stage right now , and yesterday a hearing lasting only 15 minutes was held .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .

Does anybody think that housing prices could fall next year ?
