In the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major Hong Kong media .
With their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused Hong Kong to be a focus of worldwide attention .
The construction of Hong Kong Disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 .
In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of Lantau Island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .
Since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in Hong Kong .
As its neighbor on Lantau Island , Hong Kong International Airport had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .
The subway to Disney has already been constructed .
At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for Disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens .
Meanwhile , the Disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park .
No media have been allowed to enter for photos .
On our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .
Although Disney Corporation chose Hong Kong as the venue for the Chinese Disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market .
Since the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit Hong Kong .
From the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists have , have come to Hong Kong .
At this point , it has been about two years .
Also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .
Here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .
You can go to burn incense and make a vow at the Repulse Bay , where all deities gather .
You can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in Hong Kong .
After dark , cruise Victoria Harbor at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .
Every corner of Hong Kong is filled with fun .
Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the Hong Kong tourism industry bring us ?
Over the past 28 years , the Ocean Park has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to Hong Kong .
Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .
However , since Disney entered Hong Kong , the Ocean Park , sharing the same city as Disney , has felt the pressure of competition .
It seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
That is , the entire park will be divided into seven sections for renovation .
Ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .
It seems that those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center will also be renovated after several years .
Are they going to be different from what they are now ?
They will be , in ten years .
Ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .
It looks like we will also bring in whales .
Er , we will implement this plan as soon as it is approved by the government .
The population is dense .
Natural resources are relatively scarce .
Among these is the Avenue of Stars .
Entering Hollywood of the East ,
here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .
She is my Goddess , ah .
Please stay with us on New World Travel .
Over the past 100 years of film history , Hong Kong cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .
They have shortened the distance between Hong Kong and the world .
Across from the Avenue of Stars , a special performance is staged every weekend .
So , one idea was to transform Victoria Harbor into a performance stage .
Er , each key building is like a performer .
It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .
Let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .
Their performances will be on schedule .
Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .
Some , er , cities have consulted with us .
Uh-huh .
This is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the Hong Kong government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .
At the highest point of Hong Kong , er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .
Ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,
but behind me is our Wetland Park .
Ha , entirely different .
Quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , the Wetland Park Exploration Center .
Then , the bridge is , on the bridge is Hong Kong and outside is Shenzhen .
You can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .
Children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our daily life .
Over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .
Ha , there are aquatic plants inside .
Ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many Hong Kong children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .
The long one over there .
Oh .
With , with ears , ah .
Where ?
Ah , here .
As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
Uh-huh .
Ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world .
Wow .
Um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to Hong Kong to spend the winter .
Some of them , er , have stayed in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Ah , we have established the year 2006 as Discover Hong Kong Year .
Why is that ?
In addition , we will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the Giant Buddha .
They add to what we already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous .
We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year .
Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .
A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .
Because your line connects us with two --
For this reason , Lantau Island has become a new Hong Kong tourism popular spot .
In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas .
As a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .
However , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .
Since this giant bronze Buddha settled on Lantau Island , the world renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and Disneyland have also been constructed here in succession .
The important status of Lantau Island is increasingly apparent .
No , it was totally inaccessible in the past .
In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting Hong Kong , Zhuhai , and Macao .
In 1992 --
However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .
This is what we have seen since 1999 .
Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .
Well , originally the construction of the new --
From the perspective of either Hong Kong , Macao , or Zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone .
Each place has different attractions of its own .
Once the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in Macao before having fun at Disneyland just an hour later .
Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun .
Ah , currently it has been decided that Disney will open on September 12 .
Ah , they are now rehearsing .
Ah , different , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in September .
Well , I am very confident , that when our tourists come to Disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfied .
This dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .
What determined the position of Hong Kong as a shopping paradise ?
Is it because of abundant merchandise or high quality at low prices ?
Is it a paradise for the rich or the general public ?
After all , what are the joyful memories from inside paradise ?
We respectfully invite you to watch Hong Kong : a Shopping Paradise in this edition of Across China .

Please watch this edition of Hot Topic Analysis for a detailed report .
The KMT vice chairman arrived at party headquarters to meet with KMT Chairman Lien Chan on the afternoon of %pw .
After a long talk of over an hour , Wang Jin - pyng expressed his wish not to renew his term as KMT vice chairman .
He said that he will follow Lien Chan as a lifelong volunteer .
What kind of memory ?
We respectfully invite you to watch a special edition of Across China .
Standing tall on Taihang Mountain is the Monument to the Hundred Regiments Offensive .
It is composed of a primary stele , secondary steles , a huge round sculpture and beacon tower , and the Great Wall , among other things .
A primary stele , three secondary steles , and two inscribed steles .
This is Zhuanbi Village , Wuxiang County of Shanxi Province , where the Eighth Route Army was headquartered back then .
This map reflected the European battlefield situation .
In 1940 , the German army invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia , Poland , the Netherlands , Belgium , and France .
In May , the Japanese army launched --
From one side , it seized an important city in China called Yichang .
Um , Yichang , uh , through Yichang , it could directly reach Chongqing .
Ah , that threatened Chongqing .
Then they would , ah , bomb these large rear areas such as Chongqing .
So , along with the coordinated , er , economic blockade , military offensives , and strategic bombings , er , a simultaneous attack was launched in Hong Kong to lure the KMT government into surrender .
The progress of this coordinated offensive was already very entrenched by then .
The Eighth Route Army guerrillas were extraordinarily active , creating more and more trouble for the Japanese army in North China .
In December 1939 , Commander - in - chief Zhu De and Vice Commander Peng Dehuai of the Eighth Route Army received a top - secret telegram from Commander Lu Zhengcao of the Jizhong Military District , among other people .
The telegram said that the Japanese troops were building blockade trenches and chessboard - like roads to divide the Jizhong base area into small isolated blocks without the ability to mutually communicate and support each other , causing the Eighth Route Army and the guerrillas to lose maneuverability .
Before the Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940 , an inclination to compromise , ah , surrender , was an extremely serious crisis in the frontline situation in China .
Well , on the battlefield behind enemy lines , in order to take over , consolidate the area under its occupation , Japan began a new strategy .
In addition , it relied on this cage , ah , to further strengthen its assaults against the base areas .
Er .
So , it was amidst such a grave international and domestic situation that the Eighth Route Army led by the Chinese Communist Party , ah , launched , ah , a strategic offensive called the Hundred Regiments Offensive .
This plot of the Japanese army drew great attention from Zhu De and Peng Dehuai of Eighth Route Army headquarters .
After meticulous studies and painstaking preparations by many parties , a battle plan based on surprise was formulated .
What was the purpose , purpose and goal of this campaign ?
Well , the Hundred Regiments Offensive was divided into three phases .
Beginning from August 20 , from August 20 to September 10 , the main purpose of the campaign was to sabotage the Zhengtai Railway .
Along this railway line was the Niangziguan Pass , a natural barrier , and the Jingjing coalmine , a key fuel base in Yangquan for the Japanese military in North China .
Outside of Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang , the Japanese military deployed the 4th , 8th , and 93rd mixed brigades and regiments , which were scattered among 50 strongholds along the railway line .
The situation was getting worse and worse for the Eighth Route Army and the anti-Japanese areas behind enemy lines .
Actions had to be taken to break through the blockade .
On a night in late July 1940 , the atmosphere in Zhuanbi Village in Shaanxi was unusual . Villager Xiao Jianghe has a vivid memory of this piece of history .
Some folks got up .
Opening the street gate , they saw a soldier standing by the gate .
Folks , go back , go back , nothing is wrong .
Our troops are just going to stay here for the night .
Ah , so we went back to sleep . Ah , why should you come out if you were told not to ?
It was an arduous battle .
At 10:00 p.m. on August 20 , 1940 , various units of the Eighth Route Army launched a full - scale offensive according to the general plan .
Led by Nie Rongzhen , the Shanxi - Chahar - Hebei Military District was ready for an offensive , while at the same time , fifteen regiments laid an ambush in advance along the Zhengtai Railway , launching fierce attacks on Japanese military strongholds along the railway line .
It was also during the night of August 20 that the 129th Division directed by Division Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping , with eight regiments , including two regiments of the 1st Dare - to - Die Corps and eight independent battalions , formed left - flank and right - flank commandos and a central contingent .
On the night of August 20 , offensives were launched against most of the Japanese independent 4th mixed brigade and part of the independent 9th mixed brigade along the western section of the Zhengtai Railway .
Additionally , two regiments , together with local armed forces in places such as Pingding , Liaoxian , and Yushe , carried out sabotage on the Pingliao and Yuliao roads and pinned down the enemy at various points , ensuring safety of the main forces on the sides and rear .
Current estimates are that this section was taken care of in less than four hours , three hours .
After this was taken care of , four blockhouses were blown up .
It was still during this night that the 120th Division , directed by Division Commander He Long and Political Commissar Guan Xiangying , with 20 regiments , sabotaged the northern section of the Tongpu Railway and some main roads west of the railway . It also took over strongholds at Yangfangkou , Kangjiahui , and Fengrui Village , cutting off the northern section of the Tongpu railway and the roads from Xinxian to Jingle and Fenyang .
In order to coordinate with breakthrough battles at the Zhengtai Railway and the northern section of the Tongpu Railway , the 129th Division and the Shanxi - Chahar - Hebei Military District also ordered their units to deploy more than 50 regiments Yang to Lishi in cooperation with militias , to launch widespread sabotage and raids on the Pinghan , Pingsui , Beining , Baijin , Jinpu , and Deshi railway lines , among others , as well as some main roads and many strongholds occupied by the Japanese army .
On the afternoon of August 22 , Peng Dehuai was listening to the combat operation director report on battle developments at Eighth Route Army operational headquarters .
Well , it was a force of more than 200,000 soldiers .
In addition to that , er , no less than 400,000 militiamen , guerrillas , and civilians , er , voluntarily participated in the offensive .
So , there were probably 600,000 - plus soldiers and civilians .
Our troops were strong , troops were strong . Er , and those in charge of logistics and support were able to follow in time .
It did not know how many of us went to destroy the roads , whether it was the Eighth Route Army or not , the regulars , or others . It did not know , right ?
After all , its telephones had stopped working .
Yeah , the roads had been cut off , with its vehicles unable to drive back and forth .
The following seven days and nights were extremely tough .
In addition , many people were poisoned when toxic gas was released .
They were poisoned and did not know how to protect themselves against the poison . They simply crawled on the ground and wetted handkerchiefs in the rain to cover their noses against the poison .
Eh , medics were quite busy .
The battle proceeded very smoothly , with the initiative steadily in the grasp of the Eighth Route Army .
The various units of the Eighth Route Army taking part in the battle wasted no time destroying the roads .
They proposed not to leave behind a single rail , a single cross tie , a single railway station , a single blockhouse , a single bridge , or a single electricity pole .
They mobilized and organized the masses and won over the railway staff , making great effort to destroy the railroad , the stations , and related facilities by means including dismantlement , explosion , fire , and water .
I was in charge of this , er , and --
Er , er , due to this --
He , I was responsible for this project , ah .
The militiamen were divided into two groups . One was responsible only for cutting electrical wires , and the other for destroying roads .
We people , ah , were under his command for the time being .
We all took part in destroying roads .
From the Zhengtai road , from , um , Zhengding to , um , Shijiazhuang , to Taiyuan , more than 400,000 civilians participated in destroying roads .
Most important at that time along the Zhengtai road was mainly to destroy the Jinxi coal mine .
Soldiers used hay cutters to sever the wire net , charging into the station and destroying the machine room and water tower , and then started to destroy the road .
Of the three to four thousand civilians participating in the battle , one soldier was added to every squad of 16 people formed .
For cutting electrical wires , the militiamen in the village were waiting for the troops to come ,
Ah ,
It was built during the day , and at night , overnight militiamen shoveled it over .
The task of the 72nd Regiment was , er , this destruction battle .
This destruction battle went on for a day and a night . Each day the general situation was different .
-LSB- -LSB- They attacked small bridges and small districts , and generally looted these stations . -RSB- -RSB-
They carried away the iron , the iron rails of the railway , er to make steel .
In this way , they fought the battle while at the same time destroying roads , stripping the entire 60 - li - long railway from Xingtai to Neiqiu within just a few days .
In this way , a blockade line of steel regarded as a lifeline by the Japanese army was paralyzed .
Overseas Japanese in Yangquan City were all mobilized to participate in the battle , including children of 15 to 16 years of age . They wanted to have , overseas compatriots get together so that they could support one another in wiping out the Eighth Route Army and foiling our movement to destroy roads .
During the first phase from August 20 to September 10 , 1940 , a general offensive was launched on major transportation lines such as the Zhengtai , Tongpu , Pinghai , and Jinfu lines with an emphasis on destroying the Zhengtai Railway .
During the second phase from September 22 to early October , the mission was to continue expanding battle achievements , to destroy the flanks of transportation lines , and to penetrate puppet strongholds in anti-Japanese bases .
During the third phrase from October 6 to December 4 , the main task was to counterattack a retaliatory sweep by the Japanese army and puppet army .
To those who have never experienced wars , wars are vivid stories . To those who have experienced wars , war is the course of life , part of life .
Everyone has their own memory , has the Hundred Regiments Offensive as their own memory .
Hey , this was my life .
A washbasin was also very precious . How was the washbasin used ?
This photo taken back then by Eighth Route Army field correspondent Xu Xiaobing is a snapshot of Peng Dehuai directing the campaign at the frontline of the Hundred Regiments Offensive .
Just as Mao Zedong once praised : Who dares wield his sword and make his horse rear ? Only our great General Peng .
Oh .
A total of 46,480 Japanese soldiers and puppet soldiers were killed , wounded , or captured , or defected .
After the Eighth Route Army launched the Hundred Regiments Offensive , newspapers from areas behind enemy lines in North China to the large rear area continuously carried news of victories .
Old Li Jingtang still tells visitors old war stories circulating in the Taihong Mountain area .
During World War II , the two hundred thousand strong Chinese Expeditionary Force went abroad to fight .
We respectfully invite you to watch a bloody battle fought side - by - side by China , the US , and Britain 60 years ago in a joint effort to repel Japanese invaders .

Good-bye !
News and events happen every day . What you are interested in is exactly what our focuses are .
Prior to the APEC meeting , Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited Yasukuni Shrine for the fifth time and was strongly condemned by Asian nations such as China and South Korea .
What kind of situation will Japan find itself in at the APEC summit ?
Hello , dear viewers !
Welcome to the live broadcast of Focus Today on the Chinese International Channel .
The APEC meeting is being held these days in Pusan , South Korea .
The reason is that in its persistent alignment with the US , Japan has ignored its relations with other countries , especially its Asian neighboring countries .
What is clearly remembered by its Asian neighboring countries is that on October 17 this year , in spite of opposition , Junichiro Koizumi stubbornly visited , ah , visited Yasukuni Shrine for the fifth time during the four years since he took office .
We have invited to our studio Professor Liu Jiangyong and Professor Jin Xide , two experts on Japan issues .
Welcome you two to the studio to participate in our program .
Well , we all know that Koizumi arrived in Pusan this afternoon .
In the afternoon he met with South Korean President Roh Moo - hyun .
The two met .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
All these must be properly resolved before the relations between the two countries can improve .
Uh-huh .
Well , Koizumi , he also said , that is to say , er , argued slyly for himself , ah , he said , er , that his visit was not to glorify the war .
Uh-huh .
Nor was this for anything else . It was only done to express condolences on the war dead .
Uh-huh .
However , this was still not accepted by the South Korean side .
Well , after the meeting between the two sides , we were very interested in this .
That is , originally this year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Korea and Japan .
%pw fortieth anniversary .
Uh-huh .
Yes , yes , the year of friendship .
Uh-huh .
Er , well , according to the original arrangement , that is , President Roh Moo - hyun should pay a visit to Japan , ah , at the end of this year .
Uh-huh .
Right .
Uh-huh .
Some commentaries said that when Koizumi went to meet with Roh Moo - hyun this time , it was like clutching at a straw to save his life .
Eh , it means that you see , although many neighboring countries are complaining about me , my image may return to a better one after I met with Roh Moo - hyun .
However , based on the outcome , just as Professor Liu %pw introduced , it was equivalent to going there to get criticized again .
Uh-huh , to him .
He , that is to say , to Japan , to Prime Minister Koizumi , this is a very difficult diplomatic journey .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
But , he seized the opportunity fully to express the wish of the South Korean government and people .
Uh-huh .
What he meant by the wish was to stop visiting Yasukuni Shrine .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
So , this only hope of his was also destroyed .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Yeah .
Well , this is because he is still using the pre-Cold - War diplomatic thinking after the Cold War , that is , the United States is the number one superpower in the world .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
As long as these two countries stand together , then it seems that other countries could not do anything to them .
Uh-huh .
Well , this is actually a very overbearing image .
Uh-huh .
Well , looking at the situation in Asia , actually , it is exactly the other way round .
Uh-huh .
That is to say , if it does not get on good terms with its Asian neighboring countries , then in reality the US will become even more hard - line in its diplomacy with Japan .
As for Japan , to the US , it furthermore has lost some assets , diplomatic assets when making negotiations with the US .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
That is , a bit regretful .
Because , according to the two - plus - two intermediate report just reached , the US military bases in Japan should undergo adjustment .
However , it was met with strong opposition from the general public in Japan .
Uh-huh .
So , now the JDA head came to talk with the US , saying , whether our interests can be taken into consideration again , er , in this intermediate report .
That is , between the US and Japan , centering upon this intermediate report , actually the deal is again partially completed .
Uh-huh .
So , such a prime minister like Koizumi , who blindly follows the US as the guideline of his diplomacy , was rarely seen even during the Cold War era .
Uh-huh .
We know that in 1957 Japan had three diplomatic principles . That is to say , it must take good care of its relations with the Western countries , Asian countries , and the United Nations .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Right .
It takes three points to support a plane .
Yeah .
So , it turned out that they had such stuff on the surface .
Well , some prime ministers before Koizumi at least would still properly deal with and balance the relations with America , with the US and Asia , in particular , with China , ah .
Uh-huh .
Well , when it comes to Koizumi , he only takes good care of the relations with the US .
Right .
In fact , he will surely fail to take good care of the relations with the US because if you can not win the trust of your Asian neighboring countries , the US will not fully respect such a country .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
The US also wants to go beyond Japan to keep good relations with China , South Korea , and other Asian countries . Therefore , the more he follows the US , the lower will be his actual status in Asia .
Uh-huh .
It is impossible .
Right , his idea was actually criticized and opposed by some politicians even in Japan .
Ah .
The domestic economy was also affected .
Many people also mentioned , by valuing the US alone , you are ignoring Asia .
Yes .
Now many media all issued statements and editorials .
Therefore , some people also compared this diplomacy of his to a lame diplomacy .
Yeah . He --
Eh , as far as Koizumi himself is concerned , what is his problem ?
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
He said , er , Sino - Japanese relations , ah , right now , Japan - China relations are not like , er , what the international community is worried about .
Uh-huh .
Well , the economic trade %pw development in our two countries is going on quite well .
Uh-huh .
Actually , due to his visit to Yasukuni Shrine and the cooling down of the political relationship , %pw %pw %pw Sino - Japanese relations have suffered severe blows .
He is only indulging in his unilateral wishful thinking .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Yeah . He --
Uh-huh .
It is not like that in reality .
Uh-huh .
Well , when Koizumi visits Yasukuni Shrine , he is betting on the national interests of Japan . That is to say , he is selling the international image and national interests of Japan at cheap prices .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
So this is being paid at a heavy price .
Uh-huh .
with national interests .
Uh-huh .
Right .
Well , it also precisely reflects a current political trend of forces surrounding the Koizumi administration .
Uh-huh .
It also reflects that nowadays Japan , in its eagerness to become a political power , well , wants to take advantage of the sentiments of extreme nationalism to move toward and realize this goal .
For instance , they have a kind of , a kind of wrong doing . That is to say , if Japan wants to become a powerful country commanding true respect , it must get rid of the name of a defeated country , the name of an aggressor country in World War II .
Uh-huh .
So , they chose a very dangerous road .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , he chose the wrong road .
Ah , in addition , from his point of view , he is counting on his luck to a large extent . We can also say that some think tank people around him may have given him the wrong idea .
Perhaps he was misled , wow .
Ah .
For example , regarding his visits to Yasukuni Shrine , he simply thinks , he says , if I keep doing it , keep doing it like this , you China , South Korea , ah , you , that is to say , you will be tired of protesting , grow tired of protesting .
Once you see a lot of it , you will get used to it .
So , you will swallow the bitterness while I keep doing like this .
Uh-huh .
He did not know the seriousness of the issue .
This is , this is an issue of principle .
Right .
Well , we can say that an overall review of the current diplomatic status of Japan should show two clear roads . Ha , one is to follow the US blindly , which is one of its very important diplomatic lines .
And we can also see the other one , that is , to continue damaging the relations with its close neighbors
On April 1 , 2005 , the Japanese Ministry of Education approved a new edition of history textbooks compiled by the new history textbook compilation committee and published by Fusosha Publishing House and announced the result officially on April 5 .
With regard to the Yasukuni Shrine where class A WW II criminals are honored , in spite of opposition from all sides , Koizumi persistently paid a series of five visits there from 2001 to 2005 .
Originally , Koizumi , ah , took office because he won a very high support rating as a reformer .
In the diplomatic field , there has been constant friction with neighboring countries .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
That is to say , their tones might be different , but the consensus of Japanese public opinion is that relations with Asian countries must be improved . So , this has already become the mainstream Japanese public opinion .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , specifically , it means prohibiting visits to Yasukuni Shrine . This has been opposed by the Liberal Democratic Party and all opposition parties .
Well , we know that the most important pillar in Japan that supports the Japanese society is the Japanese business community .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Right .
Well , to Japanese people , what they are more concerned with is , for example , how my economy is developing , how my life will be , whether the national interests will be damaged , whether my personal interests will be affected , and so on and so forth .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Er , he himself thought , er , that he was probably 100 % , 200 % , er , 200 % correct in what he has been doing .
Uh-huh .
However , in his diplomatic efforts , in terms of relations with neighboring countries , well , we should say , we can say that he indeed failed miserably .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , externally , it mainly relies on the US and Chinese markets .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
This effect may not show until probably next year .
Uh-huh .
Well , just now Professor Liu said , that is to say , it was the political coldness that totally damaged its relations with neighboring countries .
Uh-huh .
Then , in terms of economy , he has also been unable to keep the economic heat on .
Uh-huh .
That is , this year marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , among many reasons that blocked Japan from getting accepted this year , the most important one was that its neighboring countries did not cast favorable votes .
It failed to gain the support of countries in its own region .
Right .
To become a permanent member of the Security Council , the most important thing is to first win the support of your own region .
Right .
Well , right now it is its neighboring countries that did not support it .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
This is the most serious cost .
Well , many countries have all abandoned their hopes to further mend their relations with Japan .
In this respect , %pw such a question follows , that is , how far could Koizumi go following his diplomatic policy ?
Uh-huh .
In fact we can see that he is sort of determined on this issue to fight against neighboring countries to the end .
Uh-huh .
This way , he actually sent out a message that he has no sincerity in improving , during his term , improving the relations with neighboring countries .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
This will indeed lead to the great disappointment of neighboring countries in him , and furthermore to their caution about whether next , the prime minister , the defense minister , including , er , the foreign minister would all go pay their respects at Yasukuni Shrine .
If that is the case , it may have produced a very extensive negative impact on its relations with neighboring countries .
Uh-huh .
Well , actually , right now even the European and US media have noted this issue .
Right .
We , including US President Bush , who came to Pusan following his visit to Japan this time and then will arrive again in China , are , in fact , also very concerned with this future development of Sino - Japanese relations .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
That is because I recently met an American scholar whose first question to me was whether there will be any conflict in the East China Sea region .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
In fact it is not merely an issue of Sino - Japanese relations or Japanese - Korean relations .
It has triggered that --
Yeah .
the nerves of the international community .
Yeah .
That is , the US public and scholars have started , started to show concerns over the issue of right and wrong in WW II , the moral issue , that is , the US has started to pay attention to this issue .
The US has kept quiet on the issue of Yasukuni Shrine because it wants to get along with everyone .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Yeah .
This is one of the important indexes that I , we should watch for regarding which road exactly Japan will take .
However , based on the selection and formation of his , er , cabinet , it seems that Koizumi is making his post-resignation arrangements , ah . He has started to get ready .
The Koizumi era , well --
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , following that , for instance , if his successor is indeed Shinzo Abe , well , what will it mean if Shinzo Abe takes office ?
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
That is , in fact , I now feel that he , er , is somewhat adopting a China policy that separates politics from economy .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Right .
He is using some , eh , people who are , for instance , er , relatively moderate and pragmatic toward China .
Right .
Right , right , right . For instance , for instance , a politician quite friendly with China , that is , Toshihiro Nikai , um , was appointed as minister of Economy , Trade and Industry .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , we also see that after Nikai took office , his speech on the Eastern China Sea issue , we should say , is quite appropriate .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Ah , in his opinion , he wants to have friendly negotiations , ah , with China if he sees that China , er , has taken any action .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
But , can his diplomacy featuring two separate political and economic lines work ?
Eh , we need to watch for it this year .
Uh-huh .
Well , now Koizumi is constantly sending out the message that he will step down voluntarily in September next year .
Well , of course we could not believe completely 100 percent of what he said about this , because it is not certain whether they will make accommodations to let Koizumi stay in office .
But , if he steps down in September next year , we will see who on this cabinet will be the prime minister .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
This Koizumi has made some preparations after all , that is , he made dual preparations .
Uh-huh .
So , we still have to urge this Japanese government , ah , not to continue isolating itself like this .
We are certainly willing to watch for this , and will continue to monitor Japan .
Uh-huh .
But , could you analyze and predict what kind of achievements he can make during his trip to Pusan ?
Well , I think that actually the greatest achievement for him is that he should see facts .
What kind of facts ? That is , the issue of right and wrong .
Er , as two powers are juxtaposed , the relations between the two countries have become somewhat tense .
Uh-huh .
Well , the current trade between China and South Korea has reached nearly 100 billion US dollars .
Uh-huh .
Yeah .
So , this will have surpassed what it is now for Japan and China which still failed to reach 200 billion US dollars at this 33rd anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relations .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
It is the same with Russia .
Yeah .
We should say , should say that people in the world are very clear about what is right and wrong .
It is all in the hearts of people .
Yeah .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
That is to say , this time he could only further expose his poor diplomatic skills and his isolation to the international community .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , based on his past remarks and deeds , it is hard to determine whether he will suddenly change his diplomatic policy after he returns .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , there is very little chance in this regard .
Yes .
Thank you too , dear viewers , for watching ! Good-bye .
Over the weekend , the weather in the South will change significantly .
Although it is still overcast and rainy tomorrow from the eastern part of the southwestern region to this area south of the Yangtze River , it will turn cloudy by the day after tomorrow in the area south of the Yangtze River .
Well , it is a very pleasant thing that the long - awaited sunny weather following a long period of rain should occur on Sunday because people can arrange some outings .
However , I need to caution you that as the temperature is not climbing up significantly after the rain is over , the weather will still feel somewhat gloomy and cold .
On the weekend winds of forces 4 will blow across the northeast region .
In addition , there will be snowfall in southern Gansu .
Hello , dear viewers . Welcome to Focus Today .
It can be said that the four northern islands issue is always an obstacle that Putin can not sidestep while visiting Japan .
Heading a Russian business delegation of more than one hundred people this time , Putin wants to improve bilateral relations through promoting economic development .
Well , how will the four northern islands issue dead knot be untied ? And will economic and trade exchange between Russia and Japan be hampered because of this ?
Hello !
The other one is Mr. Xing Guangcheng , an expert on Russian issues from the Academy of Social Sciences .
Hello !
Welcome to the two experts , for coming to the studio for our interview .
Hello , Professor Wang .
Ah , hello , host !
Eh , well , President Putin and Prime Minister Koizumi , ah , the two talked for a total of two and a half hours and signed a total of 12 documents . It should be said that quite a large number of documents were signed .
However , the general reaction from scholars , media , or ordinary people here , er , is rather low key , because , er , there has been no progress on the two issues that Japan is relatively concerned with , the Northern Territories issue , er , and the oil pipeline route issue .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Regarding the Northern Territories issue , this Russian , er , President Putin purposely avoided this issue , that is , he did not really want to talk about it .
Uh-huh .
Well , in fact , it can be said that there has still been no progress on territorial issues .
Uh-huh .
So the two sides abandoned plans for a joint declaration .
Well , on the oil pipeline route issue , though the Russian side promised to connect it with Japan , there was no talk about prioritizing a connection with Japan .
The media here is concerned because Russia already promised to prioritize connecting it with China , er , %pw , so the media here is concerned that it is an empty promise .
Er , in addition , at the Business Federation meeting , Russian President Putin urged the Japanese business community to invest in Russia .
Uh-huh .
Host .
Er , it is still rather , er , low key .
Well , they are also extremely dissatisfied because no progress has been made on this issue .
Well , both the media and citizens have such concerns , that is to say , they are afraid that resolution of territorial issues may take rather .
Host .
Okay , thank you very much , Professor Wang , for briefing us on the relevant information in Japan .
Thank you ! Well , next we will return to the studio to interview the two experts in the studio .
Right , this is rather consistent with unanimous international public opinion analysis as well as our opinion these days .
Uh-huh .
Well , this , this , this discussion , it was a meeting of the leaders of both sides , which by itself is an achievement .
Uh-huh .
As we know , Putin has kept putting off this visit to Japan since last year , like back then when Yeltsin repeatedly postponed his trip to Japan .
That is to say , Japan asked for too high a price .
Well , %pw , well , the Russian president was still unwilling , was unwilling to make concessions . Therefore , the itinerary was not decided for a long time .
Well , this Japan , from the perspective of Japan , without discussion of territorial issues , the talks were viewed as making no progress . For Japanese citizens , this was meaningless .
Uh-huh .
It only provided Koizumi with a diplomatic stage .
Uh-huh .
including the development of oil resources in eastern Siberia , and , um , some other investment and trade .
Well , Japan is still like this , saying first return the territories , then we can talk about economics .
Uh-huh .
Eh , he should be said to have achieved his aim .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Because with large preconditions having been set , and now the framework having being set , it is impossible for Putin to have further substantive , that is to say , to make major breakthroughs on the substantive issues of Russian - Japanese relations .
Uh-huh .
Well , as two neighboring nations , ah , relations between them should be developed , development of relations should be further promoted . There should be exchanges back and forth , which would not work if Putin refuses to go , refuses to come .
So , well , how did he come , how did he come to Japan ?
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
As to what kind of result you want , that is another matter .
Right .
But making the trip was significant in itself .
What was the significance ? It was that Russia sent a very important message , that is , Russia is willing to develop relations with Japan .
Both leaders saved a bit of face .
They both gave face .
Right .
It is another matter if you care about the size of the documents .
Uh-huh .
Well , can we interpret it this way ?
Based on the briefing given by you two experts , both Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Russian President Putin , they both achieved their own aims in form and got or , er , obtained what they wanted through this visit .
On this point , their two fates are connected .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , as you should know , it is entirely impossible , impossible behavior .
Right .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , recently Taro Aso again proposed , that is , new Prime %pw , new Foreign Minister Aso proposed a theory of joint development , that is , to postpone -LSB- -LSB- the issue of sovereignty of the northern -RSB- -RSB- and to jointly develop the four , four islands , four islands .
Well , in fact the theory of joint development was originally proposed by Russia . Well , in the past , for instance , in 1996 , Primakov also proposed it when he was foreign minister .
It had been raised prior to that too , but Japan did not accept it at that time .
Well , why did Taro Aso recently again propose such a , er , such a suggestion ?
Uh-huh .
Well , domestic political circles in Japan all opposed this suggestion by Taro Aso .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Right .
Uh-huh .
Right .
They dropped it .
Right .
What do you say about this ?
Er , it , Russia , it also has , it also has , also has its vigilance .
Uh-huh .
The four northern islands are included in this grand vision .
Right .
We can discuss this issue again in detail at the end .
well , many viewers may have some questions on this issue .
Why did Russian President Putin visit Japan again after five years , an interval of five years , after quite a few twists and turns ?
The visit was first scheduled for the second half of 2004 . The Japanese side hoped that after winning the presidential election in March of that year , Putin could personally intervene in the territorial issues existing between Japan and Russia for a long time .
However , Putin responded only with a congratulatory telegram , with no mention of his visit to Japan .
This time , on this visit between Japan and the US , er , between Russia and Japan , ah , er , as far as Japan was concerned , it really hoped that Russian President Putin would talk about the four northern islands issue during his visit .
There should be economic cooperation before we can talk about the four northern islands issue , which means that currently the two sides both insist on a condition from the other side .
Well , in this way , the conflict would become more conspicuous during the talks .
Uh-huh .
That is , whether there should be a separation of politics and economics or not . That is , whether it should be economic cooperation first or resolution of political issues first .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , this eased for a period after the Cold War during the Gorbachev era .
Uh-huh .
That is , Gorbachev recognized the four islands issue between Japan and Russia . There was nothing like this in the past .
There was nothing like this in the past . In the past , only the issue of two islands was recognized .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
When talks on the two islands came to a final decision , the Japanese prime minister retreated again to the point that politics and economics could not be separated and that political issues should still be resolved first .
Uh-huh .
Well , in addition , the Russian president was exactly the opposite , that is , denying at critical moments that there were territorial issues , that is , sometimes even the issue of the two islands .
Uh-huh .
That is , it was impossible to give the territories to Japan .
So , this shows how difficult it is to resolve Japanese - Russian relations .
Uh-huh .
Furthermore , Japan is also a very important investor overseas . However , a set of data shows that Japanese investment in Russia accounts for only 1 % of its investments overseas , that is , just over 700 million US dollars .
Uh-huh .
The most urgent time was still the 1990s .
At that time , Russia was indeed pressing for Japanese investment .
Uh-huh .
Because Russia was in a high degree , or deep degree of overall crisis .
Uh-huh .
It was like a very thirsty man who needs to drink water . At such time , he needs , needs someone else to give him a cup of water .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
It can not be said to have lost it forever . In other words , that time was the best , a relatively good period .
Uh-huh .
Why should we say that ?
Uh-huh .
Well , as a neighboring nation , especially as Japan is a world economic power , Russia really needs Japanese investment , now not Japanese aid , but its investment .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , seen from this perspective , well , %pw Japan is very important to Russia .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Therefore , just now you mentioned some figures regarding Russian - Japanese relations , that is , economic and trade relations , for such a large , such a powerful economy as Japan , well , it invested only 700-plus million in Russia . This is extremely small .
Uh-huh .
This is a very small figure in terms of trade relations between two countries .
It has nearly reached 200 billion between China and Japan .
So . Right .
Right . Here it has a comparison .
er , between Russia and Japan , the trade volume only equals , of Sino - Japanese trade volume , one twenty - second .
It shows -- I will explain two issues -- one , it may show that the economic environment in Russia is indeed not very good .
Uh-huh .
In general , none of the various countries , eh , large nations in the world , have entered the Russian market with much ease .
Uh-huh .
It has always been the territorial issue .
Well , as we said , this kind of nationalist sentiment plays a great role here .
Uh-huh .
However , he can promote the development of economic relations , as economics is a dynamic factor .
Uh-huh .
Right , right .
Right , I think .
However , based on this outcome , the form still seems to have outdone the content .
Well , at that time it , it still , they still wanted to solve the population problem .
Uh-huh .
So this , that is , Japan used economics for political purposes .
Uh-huh .
Well , now it seems that Koizumi has still not changed this course .
Uh-huh .
Yes , this is , eh , just now Director Xing mentioned a very important issue , that is , the nationalist sentiment .
Okay .
They are some focused right - wing groups , similar to a gang society .
With ancestors constantly changing , both sides had their own arguments .
In fact , ownership of the Northern Territories has changed several times , and there has been no single law . Therefore , there is truth on both sides .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
However , then there is a lot of nationalist sentiment , that is , Japan believes that the Soviet Union unilaterally broke the Pact of Neutrality , sending troops into Northeast China and defeating the Kwantung Army .
Uh-huh .
Therefore , unraveling this historical feud , the Northern Territories issue , is not so clear - cut , since history , society , and law , as well as nationalist sentiments are all entangled together .
In August 1945 , the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in succession .
To ask the Soviet Union to declare war against Japan , the US and Britain gave Russia the Chishima Islands and the southern part of Sakhalin Island , which Japan occupied at the time .
In 1955 the Soviet Union and Japan began negotiations regarding the normalization of relations .
The then Soviet Union indicated willingness to return the Khabomai Rocks and Shikotan .
Yet Japan requested that the Soviet Union return Iturup and Kunashiri as well .
It also requested that the Soviet Union promise to attend the international peace conference to determine the ownership of Sakhalin and the entire Chishima Islands .
In 1956 , the then Soviet Union restated its willingness to return the Khabomai Rocks and Shikotan .
For a long time , Japanese - Russian relations have not made breakthrough progress due to the deadlocked four northern islands issue .
As the two experts are constantly discussing , saying that the four northern islands issue is a dead knot in Japanese - Russian relations , yet this dead knot , it seems that currently both sides have this idea , they want to untie this dead knot .
But now , we also notice that the Japanese side again proposed , Taro Aso proposed a new idea , the joint development that the Soviet Union had previously talked about .
But this is relevant .
Uh-huh .
Oh , as I just mentioned , it was against a large background that Russia first proposed it .
Uh-huh .
With quite a troubled economy , quite a troubled economy , Russia needed Japanese investment , needed Japan to get involved through this channel .
Uh-huh .
Well , now that its economy has greatly improved , Russia does not need to take this diplomatic risk .
Uh-huh .
Well , this place , the four northern islands , is a very sensitive region for the Russian psyche .
Any small , small diplomatic or economic action will affect the psyche of Russian citizens .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
This is a very , very , eh , tough kind of issue .
Well , as I just said very clearly , that is to say , in addition to the legal and historical complications , the repeated change of ownership , and then national sentiments as well , the four northern islands are also strategically very important .
Right , right .
It is both a European and Asian nation .
Uh-huh .
Fisheries .
The four northern islands not only have mineral deposits , oil , and fisheries , but also for military strategy , they are key positions in the Pacific Ocean .
In the Pacific Ocean , right .
Right , right , right .
It , if it , let me again add some words , if it wants joint development , Japanese companies and Japanese influence will enter the four northern islands .
Right , right .
Well , after entering , economy , economic influence may lead to political influence .
Currently that would seem to benefit Japan .
Uh-huh .
This is a new incarnation , but with different political significance .
Uh-huh .
Well , since the four northern islands issue is a dead knot in bilateral relations that can not be untied , and also both are working hard , yet with seemingly little hope in sight , well , how can Japanese - Russian relations develop under such circumstances ?
So , with this issue having gone on for many years , both sides may have a bottom line .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
That is to say , in the future both sides may become more reasonable on this issue .
That is , looking farther ahead , normalization of relations will still be gradually developed .
Uh-huh .
But on the other hand , the territorial issue is also quite important and sensitive .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
So the prospects for Japanese - Russian relations are not too good .
Uh-huh .
That is , it will be a normal , that is , very common , very , relatively bland kind of relationship .
Uh-huh .
Well , Mr. Xing , how do you view Russian - Japanese relations ?
That is to say , these basic tones have been set . The main issue is the four northern islands .
Uh-huh .
In addition , Putin attended the ribbon - cutting ceremony . This is quite , quite a clear signal .
That is to say , Russia -- Japan has now invested in Russia .
Uh-huh .
Though Russia did not make a final commitment , there is already a general framework .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
That is , although there are obstacles in bilateral relations , they are still exploring forward movement .
Right .
Uh-huh .
Thanks very much to the two experts for coming to the studio for our interview . Thanks to you two .
See you tomorrow at the same time .
Usually directors , otherwise , they have beards and very long hair , or otherwise they shave their heads .
Oh .
Do you have to shave it every day ?
Right , yes .
And do you need to polish it somehow ?
Then do you rub a little oil of some kind on it ?
Oh , after I shave it I rub on a little oil .
Is it cold in the winter ?
Pretty cold .
Do you wear a hat ? In the winter ?
Right .
Oh !
Although by that time his grandfather Ye Ting had been dead for 12 years , the Ye family maintained its status as a highly esteemed Communist household .
He and his little friends went fishing , raised dogs , hunted sparrows , chased ducks , and many years later these supremely happy memories are all preserved in his movies and plays .
Ducks were the most precious asset in our village .
The village mayor gave them all to me .
Did you see ? Are there 86 of them ?
And his father , Ye Zhengming , was an outstanding son of the revolution .
Because after the Wannan Incident Ye Zhengming and his father Ye Ting were imprisoned for two years in a Kuomnintang prison .
But then , and for the same reasons , just after the Cultural Revolution started , Ye Zhengming was treated as a major capitalist roader .
That year Ye Daying was just eight years old .
He changed from a very well - behaved child into a naughty child .
From that time on he often did things that went beyond the norm , sometimes to protect himself and sometimes to take care of his family .
Right , right , right , General Ye Ting .
Why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?
That marshal , afterward , after Liberation , um , it was conferred on him , so only then --
Mm .
Because ,
In fact I was a very well - behaved child .
What do you mean forced into it ?
During the Cultural Revolution , the , um , my family was considered capitalist roaders .
Mm .
So you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,
Right .
So it was because of that sort of thing ?
Right , the majority of it was like that .
Mm .
Mm .
Because you had to face them alone , OK , a dozen people who wanted to fight you .
Were you tough ?
Very tough .
Tough enough to --
Mm .
Those , good kids , they went there and threw stones .
Mm .
Finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on the head , and And I got angry , so angry that I rushed out with a shovel and hit them with the shovel .
So you picked up the shovel and rushed them .
They did , and there was a huge fuss .
Mm .
Because when I was little , having a big fight like that .
Mm .
Mm .
After the fight I went home , and my father was standing far away .
The , the , the factory , the , the , the , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters Down with Ye Zhengming , the , the , the slogan .
At the time I felt like I had a grievance .
And I felt , I was fighting for you , the people were cursing you , and I was fighting them .
Mm .
You think , you bastard .
Whack .
OK , OK , I sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at me .
Come on , take a whack at me .
Take a whack at me . Your dad knows who broke the window .
Take a whack .
Take a whack .
This is obviously him as a boy , uh , a memory of his childhood life .
Right .
Right .
Which child is you . Is this child you , or is that child you ?
So this child ,
My father was denounced , and then the rebels took us , took that child to see .
Mm .
They denounced my father , so I was very indignant ,
They let a lot of people expose my father ,
Mm .
Oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home .
But I had already said it .
What did you say ?
In fact when they said that , my mind had already eased .
Was it all ruined ? The door --
I slashed it twice .
Mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years .
It had , had a great influence on me .
Mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in Beijing .
What year was it that you moved to Shanghai ? How old were you at that time ?
Mm , well .
Mm , as he puts it , looking at it now , some of the memories can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days .
Mm .
A lot of people were very happy , very excited , because they were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?
Right , but the problem --
Because I , I had never studied well ,
His father Ye Zhengming was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day .
He was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .
Mm .
At that time in school , there were some , organized some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in that class ?
What kind of people were in your class ?
Um .
Mm .
Mm .
Lots of fun .
Mm .
So I was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study .
In this I go against the grain .
I think that --
Mm .
It was , it was like a brotherhood .
Ah , and we did some things that were out of bounds .
Mm , we helped each other .
Very sincere , very sincere and good .
When he was in that class , Ye Daying received patient teaching every day .
At that time he encountered the first love of his life that still remains fresh in his memory .
In those days if a middle school student liked a fellow - student , how did he go about expressing that ?
Mm .
Mm .
It was ,
So you went to the movies with this girl ?
Yes .
Do you still remember what movies you saw ?
So seeing The Flower Girl was the equivalent of seeing Titanic now .
Oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry .
Yes , crying her eyes out , a big film like that .
So then you cried .
Um , how was the girl , was she very pretty ?
I , now I remember that she was very pretty , mm .
Mm .
She was a very good student .
Ha ha , this --
How was it she liked you ?
So , so , when we were in class , for example you ,
I remember how it happened , yes .
Um . When we went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic .
I threw it at someone else but missed , and it hit her .
The result was that she turned her head to look .
And she looked at you angrily .
I thought , uh-oh , the expression in her eyes was like she would forgive you , that kind of feeling .
Mm .
Mm .
The --
So , so , so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right .
Mm , that female schoolmate went to the Shanghai suburbs to live and work .
Right , right , yes .
Mm , when I started it was a technical school .
Mm .
Mm .
In 1976 , there were two happy events in the Ye family .
The first was that his father , Ye Zhengming , was released and reunited with his family that he had been separated from for three years .
The second event was that Ye Daying had his 18th birthday and became an adult .
However , at this time Ye Daying , facing this opportunity that would change his fortune , was at a loss as to what to do .
Mm .
Mm .
Up to then , um , I had never thought about the future .
Mm .
Right , but the problem was , I , Because I , I had never done well in school .
So right off I felt that I was finished , the --
Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school , they could , compared to me , they had a future , um , they could stand out .
Mm .
So I was hopeless , right off I was feeling down .
Very clearly a --
It was very , the extraordinary thing was , at that time my mom was attending the film institute , she was an instructor there .
Mm .
Mm .
So then I --
It was just because there was no English exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry .
Right , it was very simple .
Mm .
Right .
His mother , An Qi , had never thought that Ye Daying would sign up to take the exam for her work unit , the Beijing Film Institute .
But Ye Daying in fact failed when he took the reinstated exam .
At that time you especially admired directors , right ?
Mm .
Mm , very tense .
Did you act then ?
I thought , this is definitely not working .
Just getting on stage gave you the shakes .
Mm .
At that time it was all , it was , always that kind of pompous stuff , or that kind of , that milquetoast kind of young male character , that kind of thing .
So then at the same time when I saw that Teng Wenji , he was probably thirty - some years old , he was the previous generation to us , very stubborn .
He could really project .
Because ultimately , there , I gradually realized this .
Mm .
Mm , I could see how they worked .
What were your lines supposed to be ?
So you --
So I had never served as a soldier , that kind of pose , it was really awful .
So after I gave that up , no , it was not that kind of thing .
So the old director , Cheng Yin , um ,
I , I attended that class for half a year , um , um and then I got sick .
Um , I got , central , an inflammation of the central nervous system , so my whole body was paralyzed .
Your whole body was paralyzed ?
Right .
Your whole body was paralyzed ?
Right . I was paralyzed for ten months .
And how did you get better , later ?
Hormones .
You took hormones .
Um , I got , every day I had a transfusion .
Mm , after you get hormones , people may get very fat .
Mm .
At that time how fat were you ?
Yah .
What do you mean ?
If I just look down , my cheeks are right here .
The flesh all atrophied , um .
If you look at when I was in middle school , based on that bit of exercise --
Later , based on that , it all evaporated .
Sometimes , oh , right .
Mm .
Get some fun .
Right , right , right , right .
Mm , together , um , wrote a -- .
Mm .
Therefore , at that time , we were talking and talking to shoot a , an urban love story , tell a love story , so he took me , at that time , that , more or less that story , as background .
Mm .
Then after I went back to Beijning , when we made arrangement and were eating together , I saw Wang Shuo for the first time
Mm .
Gave it to me , and I took it back to school to read .
Our generation could really find ourselves , I mean --
He sighed , this expresses what our generation really wants to express .
Later he was introduced by a friend , and Ye Daying met the author of the novel , Wang Shuo , at the film institute . That was the beginning of their long friendship , which continues today .
How many plays did you collaborate on ?
She says that two years before that they were already calling themselves a peasant association .
The school built a classroom building and put a lock on the gate door .
The secretary telephoned , can our association get involved and resolve this matter .
I myself put up 1,000 yuan , and with 19 people we put together 10,000 yuan , and we went to negotiate with the contractor .
In the end , the contractor came around and let the kids go into the classrooms to attend classes .
The entire problem was resolved smoothly , and it greatly increased the prestige of the peasant association in the eyes of the local villagers .
But why did a peasant organization get involved in a matter that should have been resolved by the village Party committee ?
Will peasant associations become a direction of organized rural development ?
With these questions in mind , this reporter came to Yongji in Shanxi to get the scoop .
And she spoke about her family , her husband and child , and she looked concerned and haggard .
And she would often sigh .
If you go 13 kilometers west of Yongji in Shanxi , you come to Zhaizi Village .
Previously , Zheng Bing and her husband ran a chemical fertilizer store here .
Now , they have donated the fertilizer store to the Peasants Association .
It was kind of by accident .
The first time , in fact it was , the first time was unimaginable .
The first time , organizing the first time , I , at the time that Zhaizi Technical Center was seven or eight li from our village , and it was on the banks of the Yellow River !
At the time I was afraid to ask the teacher to come because the peasants might not come to hear him , so at the time I ran from village to village , I went around organizing .
Um , and at each village , I would go around trying to find out who had the most technology awareness .
Finally , from the ten villages , I chose 80 women .
Then I got them to bring peasants from surrounding area altogether .
The class went on from just after 10 in the morning until five in the afternoon .
Nearby villagers all heard about this terrific person who dug deep into her own pockets to provide an agricultural seminar for everybody . And they all loved coming to the technical services center to buy things .
Furthermore , this center of hers became an agricultural technology exchange center for the surrounding area .
Whenever villagers would run into some agricultural production issue , they all liked to come here to look for answers .
Do you still need to provide the money for them ?
When I went to our agricultural bureau , I thought , huh , the agricultural bureau has all those technical personnel , they ought to provide services to the peasants .
Starting with the technical training , the Yongji peasant cooperative organization began to take shape .
Aside from attening the classes , the peasants began to make demands of Zheng Bing , asking her to undertake some projects .
But then it actually failed , alas !
How could it have failed ?
Then I telephoned him : given my actual circumstances , if I pay it back in six years , is that OK ?
In a farming village , 150,000 yuan is no small sum .
But because Zheng Bing was the guarantor , the credit union still took Zheng Bing to court .
At the time they filed a lawsuit against me , and the lawyer also came !
After the lawyer came , he explained these things to me , he said , the credit union has already filed suit against you .
I said , well then I still can not help with it .
The lawyer asked me , from A to Z , what happened ?
So I explained it all faithfully .
After I explained it , the lawyer looked all astonished .
So the lawyer sorted it all out .
So next year when the time expires , will you be able to pay off this 65,000 yuan ?
But the peasants need lots of services .
Ho !
So , I discussed it with the credit union .
Then they can push the six years back again .
In 1999 Zheng Bing quit her job as a teacher .
And how could I keep this from having a negative impact ?
I discovered that peasants are not entirely having no money .
So then , in practice , I let the peasants invest 50 yuan for each mu of land , invest 50 , 50 yuan .
It had no impact .
By the second year , I began to really deal with everybody , and they all knew , and I made it public .
If she could cheat you out of several tens of thousands and then she could leave the country !
These things really shook up our government .
After they all came , they said to me , Zheng Bing , we need to investigate your business .
I said , why do you need to investigate ?
Because there , leaders of different sectors from our city , they all came here to us .
When they said illegally raising capital , I was startled .
An accusation of raising capital illegally is not a small matter .
The bank investigated the matter ,
later it was persuaded and prevented by the city of Yongji .
Therefore Zheng Bing , fed up with scare , even though she was convinced that she should give up , she was really unwilling .
Who would have guessed that my husband would be strongly opposed .
I worked with him again and again .
Finally , he agreed .
Since then , no one is saying anymore that she is raising capital illegally .
And a thing that came next made the villagers not only see that Zheng Bing had a spirit of sacrifice , but her organizing skills also could instill confidence in people .
In organizing the village women , how did the dancing part come about ?
They said what ? How can we be compared to the city ?
Wow !
That first time , the first afternoon , We first got together 20 - some women in our village to dance .
Laughed at what ?
They were embarrassed !
But I saw that they were so , that kind , excited , and I felt , maybe this is the beginning of a new life .
So I persisted .
I persisted for a month .
Just imagine , 80 % of our village , that is 120 women joined in .
When was the village construction council established ? Why did you want to set up this body ?
Yikes ! After it rained , it was really tough to walk , so we went to the village committee .
At the time our village had a secretary who doubled as village head .
and the villagers discussed it collectively .
Because we all discussed things together , very intensely .
Because , first of all , these lanes are a matter of concern to all of us .
But the fact is that you yourselves selected the village construction council .
Yes .
There were no clashes .
In the end , it was actually very difficult to get this thing done , to complete it .
The number of households that became members of the association went from over a hundred before the lanes were fixed to more than 200 .
Its legal representative is Zheng Bing .
In the shareholding issue , Zheng Bing and the association members ran into a succession of problems .
For construction capital , they adopted the member shareholding approach , with a total of 300 shares at 300 yuan per share .
But they could not exceed five shares and ten shares , respectively .
Some people wanted to hold controlling shares , but you strongly disagreed .
Yes .
That , as we were organizing that cooperative paint plant , that , the paint plant , Some people proposed right away , at the meeting , they proposed , I want to hold controlling shares .
So then we began squabbling at the meeting .
That way is too arbitrary .
There are twelve households in the village that were categorized as retarded or disabled and extremely poor households .
But when Zheng Bing persisted , everyone finally agreed .
Just now you repeatedly used a word , quality .
Every month we give the association members a report .
As we began this year , we put out a report , and the report had , it presented a goal , to become the Number One Village in China within ten years .
The association is now experimenting in Zhaizi Village .
Of course some ask , some people ask you , this Number One , what does that imply ?
I say , two things .
We are all set to be Number One in these two areas .
You have to constantly overcome your own traditional , conservative kinds of thinking and antiquated concepts .
You have to constantly challenge yourself .
So this quality thing , it really has a lot of meaning to it .
Now that she has quit her teaching job , donated away her own family store , and with the development of the peasant association , the biggest issue for her now is still that of money .
They also let members buy on credit and pay it off at harvest time .
If you really total it up , my family has paid out more than 200,000 .
At 3:42 on July 28 , 1976 , a strong earthquake hit Tangshan .
On the morning of the 28th , the National Earthquake Administration called an emergency consultative meeting .
At the meeting , Huang Xiangning read the earthquake prediction that they had previously issued . This attracted the attention of people in the relevant fields .
What sort of questions did Hua Guofeng ask then ? Who else was there ?
The Tangshan earthquake was a paroxysmal earthquake .
But before this , you clearly had already reported this opinion to the analysis and forecasting office .
The report went to the Seismology Bureau , yes .
How could he say this ? This is absolutely contrary to the facts .
After I went there , after he finished the report , Premier Hua allowed me to report .
When I saw what was going on , I took the annual forecast , and I had no report .
Yes .
No .
You , the , uh , when you go back , continue with your monitoring work , monitoring and aftershocks .
And protect the Party Central Committee and protect Chairman Mao .
That was the gist of what Hua Guofeng said .
Who else was in attendance at the time ?
In attendance , uh , from the Seismology Bureau there were three of us , Director Liu Yingyong , Deputy Director Mei Shirong , and me .
The , the national leaders were Hua Guofeng ,
oh , there was Jiang Qing ,
there was Ji Dengkui , there was Wu De .
This was an informational briefing that hardly anyone knows about .
The time was January 20 , 1977 .
In the briefing , the National Seismology Bureau for the first time analyzed the reasons for the failure to report the Tangshan earthquake .
Were the reasons that led to so many deaths and injuries all that simple ?
And if the pre-quake predictions had been taken seriously , what result would that have led to ?
These are the relics and ruins left to us by the Great Tangshan Earthquake .
In that calamity , all of Tangshan was laid waste .
And yet in the county seat of Qinglong County in Hebei Province , although it is only 115 km from here , not even one person in the whole county died in the great earthquake .
On the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the Great Tangshan Earthquake , that is in April of 1996 , Qinglong was chosen by a United Nations agency to become a successful model for the integration of scientific research and administrative management .
In fact , on August 20 , 1976 , the Hebei Science Committee had issued a brief report which for the first time revealed the facts about Qinglong having successfully prepared against the Great Tangshan Earthquake .
But the report was withdrawn very quickly .
Beginning at that time , the Qinglong phenomenon gradually became known to the outside .
At the time Wang Chunqing was in charge of seismic work for the Qinglong County Scientific Committee , and it was he who first brought news of the great earthquake back to Qinglong .
Oh !
Why do you say that ?
The local manager was Wang Chunqing , the person responsible for running the Qinglong County Scientific Committee was named Wang Chunqing .
He was also on the dais opening the conference .
What was the reason ?
What reason ? He was the deputy director of the bureau , he was a group leader .
Wang Chun , Wang Chunqing participated in the first colloquium .
Ah .
He received these opinions and also heard that Tangshan Second Middle School said so ,
uh , teacher Tian Jinwu of Tangshan Second Middle School also said like that , that is , earthquake prediction is part of the three essential earthquake requisites , right ?
In late July or early August a 7.0 or higher , possibly even an 8.0 earthquake will occur , and this made a very strong impression on him .
When the meeting let out , Wang Chunqing dared not delay , and he hurriedly made the long journey to his hometown , Qinglong , because his home was in Qinglong .
At that time , with the upper levels of government not having issued any earthquake prediction , it was he that faced the risk of losing his position and on July 25 made a decision , that he had to notify everyone of the earthquake situation before July 26 .
From that moment , all of Qinglong County went into pre-earthquake mode .
After learning of this , what was Ran Guangqi , as county secretary and county head , thinking and doing ?
We had to take the initiative in this .
The worst case scenario would be losing -LRB- his -RRB- office !
It did not matter .
Right . That was one thing .
The second thing was , criticizing Deng .
Right ! A call from above , they were calling on us to criticize Deng , so we criticized Deng .
That was one problem , they were thinking like that .
Ha , the third thing was , we were really dealing with a major quake .
The mosquito sees a few welts and comes back again , right ?
The ordinary people will call us a few bad names , when it becomes worse , we bow and leave the stage .
So I issued the prediction .
On November 8 , 1976 , the National Seismology Bureau released its seventeenth seismic report .
The report said that the Tangshan earthquake had damaged 180,000 homes in Qinglong County , with 7,300 of these collapsing , but only one person had died as a direct result of the earthquake .
The miracle was that 10,000 miners working in Kailuan Mine Bureau mines successfully escaped danger in the Great Tangshan Earthquake , and this established a model for disaster prevention and preparation .
With seismologists being unable to set a date for an imminent earthquake , how can people carry out effective disaster prevention and preparation work ?
Why ?
If the power goes out and the ventilation stops , in 40 minutes or so , the gas , uh , gas , underground flooding , uh , that can quickly threaten human life .
-LRB- Power -RRB- outage , -LRB- ventilation -LRB- stop , if the power goes out and the ventilation stops for more than forty minutes , so everything has to be done in that time frame .
So only seven men died .
When the Great Tangshan Earthquake hit , the Kailuan Mine Bureau was situated in the extreme quake zone .
At the time , about half the Kailuan miners were stuck underground .
In the moment that the earthquake hit , how could they be gotten out ?
At the time , how to get them out , according to their , this , at the time , this involved several problems , very typical ones .
Um , for example , the Lu jiatuo Mine , Lu jiatuo , the Lu jiatuo Mine , the Lu jiatuo mine had a vertical - shaft ladder , and at the time there were more than a thousand people in the mine , male , female , old and young .
I was thinking , a few will get trampled .
There were regulations , they , they had it in the document in writing , new workers go up .
After the new workers had all gone up , the experienced older workers went up .
Finally , the CCP members came up last , and at the time Jia Bangyou said , CCP members come up last .
They created an inspiring miracle underground , but it was not by accident .
I really admire this group of CCP members who were at the Lu jiatuo Mine in 1976 .
Uh , after they had come up , no one at the mouth of the mine had left .
Why ?
Their mine boss , Jia Bangyou , had not yet come up .
Men , women , old and young were all at the mouth of the mine , not going anywhere .
He said , Go on ! All of you go home ! Go see whether your families are still alive .
And in the final analysis their success was manifested in their focusing on earthquakes .
Possibly we should say , if , before the quake , the relevant national departments had taken seriously the news of the earthquake forecast , would the casualties have been so high ?
Even though the Tangshan seismic monitoring network had so many , so many earthquake warning signs , uh ,
every province and city has so many emergency reporting offices , look at Tianjin , Beijing , Hebei , they all have emergency reporting stations .
How can I explain this ?
In earthquake forecasting , success means succeeding in your probing of the situation , and failure means failing in your probing .
For example , you , you take seriously , you come , your underlings forcefully request a meeting , you meet with them and you do it .
Really .
The local people all saw it coming .
I respectfully represent the 240,000 Tangshan dead , and to the people of the former Tansghan monitoring , earthquake monitoring network , you predicted the Great Tangshan Earthquake , you reported the emergency , you made every effort .
You are the pride of the people of your home town !
We love you ! And we pray for you !
In your view , is it more important to maintain social stability in the region around the capital , or is it more important that a major earthquake may cost the lives of many people ?
My appeal , one , this one , this one little crux .
Life is more important than anything else !
This has always been the pain in the hearts of many Chinese seismologists .
Before the Great Tangshan Earthquake , China had medium - long - range forecasts , it had annual forecasts , it had imminent forecasts . But in the end , the tragic result was that 240,000 people lost their lives .
Why do you believe that the leaders involved need to take responsibility for this ?
Maybe for them it was just an inadvertent mistake , or an oversight .
But we are at the level where we can say , in late July or early August , in that week of time ,
we , this all could have been said .
This has already , we have already , very clearly said that .
If you look at the Tangshan disaster records , many people might get the impression that the Great Tangshan earthquake was not just a natural disaster , but that it was made up of many human disasters . How do you see that ?
What is even more unexpected is that two Chinese seismologists who precisely predicted the Tangshan quake and who have spent a lifetime doing earthquake research coincidentally believe that China has not made progress in earthquake forecasting levels , but has actually gone backwards .
If we were once again to continue focusing on earthquake preparedness as before Premier Zhou died , with the policy of the experts and the masses working together , and combining Chinese and foreign methods , then , earthquake forecasting would be on the right track again .
I say the method of monitoring and preparedness by the masses used before the Tangshan quake , and methods that produced this prediction .
And also before an earthquake in coastal cities , the method of monitoring and preparedness by the masses , in
Children are left at home in the rural areas , after parents leave to work in the city .
I want to tell them that I miss them a lot .
Day after day and year after year , they long for love in loneliness and wait for family affection in defect .
I think that it is especially important to have emotional exchanges with the children .
Visit the children more often whenever possible .
While the situation of peasant workers in the city has repeatedly put society into question , the phenomenon of left - behind children in rural areas has gradually entered the view of the public .
In the last two years , he has led the task force to conduct many field interviews and investigations on left - behind children in numerous rural areas in central and western China , including Shaanxi , Ningxia , Hebei , and Beijing .
Why did you pick the central and western parts of China , and not the south , to conduct this study ?
When we conducted this research study , our focus was to analyze the impact on children when their parents work in the city , work in the city .
Its impact , its main impact is the lack of love because of the absence of their parents .
According to your estimation , how many left - behind children are there in China now ? This group should be the biggest in number .
Um , the most conservative statistics for the group of people who leave the country to work in the city in our country is 100 million .
Nowadays , um , many , um , many places , um , cite a figure of 120 million .
Many people quote a figure of 150 million .
Of course , families of these married people will usually have children .
Moreover , they will usually have more than one child in rural areas .
According to the study by the task force , at present , the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody , skip - generation custody , relative custody , and same - generation custody . Among which , single - parent custody had the highest number , accounting for 79.2 percent of the people surveyed .
According to your study , what do these left - behind children generally do with their daily life if their parents or parent work in the city ?
No doubt , the less impact , single - parent custody definitely creates less impact compared to the other types .
The impact of single - parent custody is smaller because at least the mother is at home .
The one that creates a huge impact is definitely skip - generation custody .
There is also relative or neighbor custody that asks neighbors or relatives to look after the children , and there is a type called self - custody .
These three types create the biggest and the most impact .
The father went first , and later the mother wanted to go , too . What happened to these two children ?
As a result , this , this , this mother sent these , these , these brother and sister to martial arts school , to martial arts school to study .
After they went to the martial arts school for a while , um , their mother was , um , a little worried , so she went to visit them .
Later , the mother was moved and brought this , this , this girl home and had the grandparents look after her .
Um , she still left the boy at home , ai , left him at the martial arts school .
Um , um , after the girl returned , the mother continued to work in the city .
You said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children .
However , for the elderly , with the difference in age and time , their , their , their , ways of taking care and loving the children are different .
They are influenced by their own habits .
Um , after all , they are different from , um , young people in this respect . Instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible , they are influenced by some , some habits in this aspect .
They , they raised this point themselves .
They also had to face such a reality , one that they could not resolve .
In the study of left - behind children , many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city , and the inculcation and upbringing cycle of their children , have formed two parallel lines that will never meet .
Farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime , while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school .
Originally , they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education . However , adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more .
This pair of unavoidable contradictions has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious . Was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ?
There was a child in Ningxia , um , there was a child in Ningxia whose name was Yao Zhengang .
This child , um , did not do exceptionally well in school . What impressed me the most about him was that he really missed his parents .
He said that he was sick one time . His father worked in Guyuan , about 40 to 50 kilometers away from home .
After his father learned that he was very sick , he ran back to the village right away . After he arrived at the village , he did not say anything , but to put him on his back and carry him to the town to see a doctor .
When the doctor in the town took a look and told him that they were unable to cure the sickness , he carried the child to the county .
Therefore , I can feel that um , um , parents who work in the city also have no alternative . They are forced into making such decisions .
There was a child , a girl in Xixiang county , Shaanxi province . Um , when I asked , " What do you think are the changes that your parents working in the city have caused you ? " She did not answer .
When she went downstairs to play by herself , an accident happened .
Her parents , um , went , before they went to work in the city , they could watch her and forbade her to go down to the cellar .
This is Ruangang village , Bocang town , Yi county , Hebei province .
Among the 303 households in the village , one - third of the families have people who work in the city .
Many people want to save some travel expenses and earn some more money , so it is very common for them not to return home for a year or two .
Life is so vast . Life is an ocean wherever life exists .
It has been six years since 14 - year - old Jiang Beiwen was sent by his parents to live with his maternal grandfather in Ruangang village .
He was only eight years old at that time .
The only connection that little Beiwen has with his parents now is to talk on the phone with them once a week .
In his opinion , affection among family members is something unreachable .
How often can your mother call you ?
Uh , once a week !
What do you talk about ?
My schoolwork was not quite good when I first came !
My mother scolded me in the beginning when my schoolwork was poor .
She said that I was losing honor for not doing well at school ! Then I cried and after that , my mother cried , too .
Since they move from place to place in the city to work all year round , parents of left - behind children have little communication with their children .
While for temporary custodians , they are only limited to providing superficial care , such as making sure the children have food and stay warm , but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating the children .
Since their parents are absent , how can these children communicate and exchange with their parents ?
Our study found that um , um , the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone .
What could they talk about in three minutes ?
Of course , we also studied what these children talked to their parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations .
What did the parents who worked in the city talk about with their children ?
He stops talking because he needs to pause to consider how to say what is in his mind .
The children have a great need for this type of telephone exchange .
Do the left - behind children understand why their parents work in the city ?
How could that be possible ?
However , a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work , including coalmines , construction , and some others , many of them are dangerous jobs .
At noon , the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather went to work in the field and did not come home .
What work are you going to do today , other than cooking ?
Uh , I will do the dishes after I finish eating .
If it is Sunday when I am free , I will also help , also do some farm work .
What kind of work ?
Uh , I will hoe the field , uh , when we are in a hurry to till the land for growing crops , I will help do some work .
Uh huh , I do .
It was especially tasty .
It is because I care about my parents very much .
I think about their work because I know that they work in the city because of me , so I care about them a lot .
They will be worn out from working in the city , working in the city to make money .
Because of you , why is it because of you ?
Then , are these children willing to live with their parents ? Or go to the city with them ?
In regard to this , first , father , children all want their parents to come back to live with them .
However , they all wanted their parents to come back , but half of the children did not want to go to the city .
We also asked them why they did not want to go to the city .
This was also very surprising to us .
They said that the city is another world and they were especially worried .
They were afraid that once they go to the city , they will not be able to assimilate into the schools and things like that .
If we are in the city every day , live in the city every day , we may know that oh , city life is like this .
As for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in the city , they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear .
As for parents , are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ?
All parents , I can say the majority of the parents , definitely want to live with their children . However , with the reality that they have to face , I believe that they can not solve this problem .
However , with the reality that they have to face , I believe that they can not solve this problem . Of course , we know what the reality is .
They have to make money to support the family .
They will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city .
If the children go to the city , the expenses will be very high . Since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or their psychological need .
Since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or their psychological need . Many parents are unable to bring their children with them .
What would you tell your parents if you could see them now ?
I want to tell them that I miss them very much . It is hard to tell from the surface . Why is it so ?
In this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect . However , many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn .
They had very strange um , um , temperaments . They did not like to speak .
There was a , a child who was in the first year of junior high school .
Um , um , he told us himself that he particularly , um , um , misses his father .
He was very good at school .
Um , um , we also asked his um , um , grandparents who had custody of him . They said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him .
They said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him . Um , of course , it was not necessarily because his parents worked in the city .
After all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete .
Therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychologically , they do not have family love .
Under this situation , I believe , I am not sure , um , I am unwilling to imagine what mentality and character these children will develop when they grow up .
Will they think that love is important in society or not , because they have never experienced it . They have never completely experienced it .
Despite the guarantee in food , clothing , and school that left - behind children get because their parents work in the city to make money , they do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that they require .
They thought that this was a reality that they could not um , um , face .
This happened in the rural area . These two children were looking after the home .
Their uncle saved them when the flood was almost past their bellies .
Their father called later to see if they were fine .
Now , Guangxi has initially formed an overall pattern of opening up to the outside world at various fields and levels , which is characterized by mutually linking together opening coastal cities , opening coastal economic zones , and opening border cities and towns , and advancing from the seacoasts , the borders , and the river borders towards the hinterland .
It has invested more than 130 billion yuan to strengthen the construction of infrastructures and basic industries so as to create a sound environment for expanding the opening up to the outside world .
To further expand the opening up to the outside and promote outwardly economic development , Guangxi has come up with a series of policies to make use of foreign investments .
Using the convenience of the channels to the sea of the great Southwest , Guangxi has also strengthened horizontal economic ties with provinces , regions , and cities such as Sichuan , Yunnan , Guizhou , Hunan , Tibet , Shanghai , etc .
According to incomplete statistics , Guangxi has cooperated with three provinces and one region in southwest China -LRB- Sichuan , Guizhou and Yunnan provinces and the Tibet Autonomous Region -RRB- alone to implement more than 1000 cooperative projects , with agreement capital of several billion yuan .

The Hangzhou new , high level technology industry development zone has actively transformed the achievements of new , high level technology , and the effect is remarkable .
So far , there are already 410 enterprises in the whole zone , among which 223 have been identified as new , high level technology enterprises .
Among them , enterprises started by universities and colleges , large scientific research institutions and large and medium sized enterprises account for approximately 70 % .
So far , more than twenty new , high level technology enterprises have collaborated with more than 10 countries and regions to establish 78 foreign - invested enterprises .
This development zone is located in the downtown area of Hangzhou , a famous Chinese scenic sightseeing city , and is a national level new , high level technology industry development zone approved for construction by the State Council in 1991 .
High levels of product and project are an important feature of this zone .
According to investigation , each enterprise entering this zone has one or more new , high level technology projects or products . Currently , more than 550 new , high level technology projects or products in the zone have entered into commercial production or marketing application .
Among them , 57 items were approved to be listed in the national , provincial and municipal Torch Plan and their quantity ratio is tops among the new , high level technology industry zones of the entire country .

According to statistics , currently , foreign enterprises listed on the New York Stock Exchange have reached more than 340 , tripling the figure 5 years ago .
Currently , the number of countries and regions whose enterprises are listed on the New York Stock Exchange is almost 50 .
On the basis of analysis , the main reason why so many foreign enterprises are listed on the US securities exchange market is the continuous and steady increase of the US economy , and that the New York Stock Exchange is a relatively ideal place for raising capital , with its strict management and regulated operation .
Statistics show that , capital that foreign enterprises raised on the New York Stock Exchange has reached 60 billion US dollars since 1992 .
But financial experts from Wall Street warn that , foreign enterprises entering the New York Stock Exchange , to a large extent , means that these enterprises need to adopt the strict operations and financial management methods of the US .
If foreign enterprises still lack the conditions to apply these methods , they should not rush blindly to enter the New York market , lest they be left out in the cold .

At the end of last year , China , at a series of meetings , pointed out that one of the key tasks of the 1998 reform is to accelerate housing system reform , to accelerate the process of transforming housing from a material allocation to a monetary allocation , and to establish a new method to monetize benefit allocations .
An obvious sign of this is the housing accumulation fund system starting to be commonly established .
According to what was revealed at the working forum on housing reform work in some provinces and cities held in Beijing recently , currently the total amount of national accumulation funds surpassed 80 billion yuan . This huge accumulation fund is playing an increasingly obvious role in supporting individuals to purchase housing and housing construction .
Although the pace of housing reform is being accelerated , the old method of allocating housing through benefits has still has not been broken through .
According to a recent survey conducted among residents of 5 cities , namely Beijing , Shanghai , Tianjin , Chongqing and Guangzhou , relying on work units to allocate housing still remains the main avenue of residential housing in these 5 cities .
In Shanghai , 62.4 % of the residents currently still have housing still under work unit allocation .
Its central content is to abolish benefit housing allocation , and at the same time to increase housing expense amounts in employee salaries .
If a one - time housing subsidy is also used , the economic environment of employees buying houses will be eased even more .
It was learned that China currently has about 66 million square meters of commercial housing overstocked .
Financial departments have been requested to develop employee personal housing mortgage and loan business to increase their purchasing ability .
Concerned departments also cancelled some fee items so as to lower housing construction costs .

The White Paper said that because of a lack of unified original production site rules , each country , when formulating its own original production site rule , often starts out from the needs of its own country , and standards differ , degrees of strictness vary , and randomness sometimes exists in assessing the original production site of imported goods .
Methods of calculating export trade according to current original production sites , make it obviously difficult to accurately reflect general trends in changes in world economic development . It could even distort the balance of trade situation among countries .
In the past two to three decades , rapid development in the processing trade in some countries and regions had increased the complexity of this problem .
Its products rely on original sales channels , transferring from places like Hong Kong , etc. to traditional markets such as the US etc .
By original production site rule statistics , product exporting countries shifted from these countries and regions to China .
The White Paper thereby drew the conclusion and held that , when using original production site statistics , its limitations must be fully recognized , superficial figures must be seen through , and the actual benefit that each party achieves from trade must be seriously analyzed .
This will then help to eliminate misunderstanding , and appropriately solve trade disputes between countries .
At the same time , one must also consider the increasingly growing trend of increasingly close international economic interaction and international investment , service trade , etc. , improve and perfect trade statistical methods , make statistical data objective and realistic , create good conditions for mutually beneficial co-operation among various countries of the world and healthy development of world economic trade .

He said that in 1996 world economic growth had some acceleration , that the pressure of global inflation was further reduced , and that the level of world economy integration significantly increased .
He pointed out that in some European industrial countries current economy lagging is mainly due to structural obstacles such as over - burdened social welfare systems and the ossification of labor markets that have been existing for a long time , etc .
Accelerating the pace of structural reform will not only be beneficial to promoting the economic recovery of these countries and the development of the European economy and currency union , but will also have active effects on the continuous growth of the world economy .
Other industrial countries should also make use of the present opportunity while the economic situation is still good to reduce budget deficits and increase the dynamics of structural reform .
The contribution of developing countries to the development of the world economy is increasingly large . The degree of contact with one another and with other countries in the world is increasing , and the disparities in economic growth between regions appear to be on a narrowing trend .
He said that in recent years the signs of globalization of the world economy are becoming more and more obvious , and that the world economy has been greatly pushed towards prosperity .
The unification of the world economy is intensifying with each passing day . Facing the challenges brought by globalization , each country should continuously implement sound economic policies and deepen structural reform so as to enjoy the most benefits from the process of globalization and to minimize the negative effects .
On the other hand , there are still a number of developing countries that have not benefited from the progress of globalization .
In this connection , he appealed to the industrial countries to eliminate obstacles to the progress of the globalization of the world economy as soon as possible .

Coal , water , oil , etc. , are normally used for traditional electricity generation .
However , using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation efficiency and lower total cost , is beneficial to the environment , etc .
According to presentations , with this type of electricity generation method , a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade . This gas in turn can heat a boiler for the production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates electricity .
Because of the efficiency of this construction method , the electricity generated is relatively competitive in price .
At the same time , using natural gas as fuel will also reduce environmental pollution along coastal regions .
The installed capacity of electricity it has invested in and developed globally has reached 15 million kilowatts .
Through the contact of the Yizhong Company of the US , the Weir Group and the Jiangsu Electric Power Department reached an initial agreement on a plan to build a joint circulatory electricity generation plant .
According to the agreement , the Weir Group will be responsible for the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by the power plant .
He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market development , liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation . When the gross national product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , etc. , environmental protection awareness generally rose , and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas .

For this , the Chinese government views with extreme importance and actively participates in international population activities , and sincerely hopes that the international community will adopt a stand of realistic resolution of population and development problems , seeking similarities while accommodating differences , co-operating closely to strive hard together towards a stable world population to create a beautiful future !

So , these two blogs have not really been very popular , either
He said that when the Caucasians conquered the new continent , the bacteria on their bodies killed far more Indians than their weapons .
What gave them the decisive advantage was smallpox .
Prior to Darwin , there were two schools of ecological thought : harmony theory and conflict theory .
For example , can a species of plant depend on itself to survive ?
It is impossible .
So he proposed that the nature was a complex network and that its members were interdependent .
This was the first stage in his research and his entire theory .
Therefore , the body hairs , which increased the friction in water , had fallen off .
The reason for this explanation is that the fine hairs on the back of humans run from one side of the shoulder toward the spine , a different direction from that of monkeys .
Only such a direction could reduce the friction in water , and provide more buoyancy for the person who is swimming in the water .
However , in all the primitive gathering settlements that have been discovered so far , we have not seen any settlement where people lived in such a way .
This is somewhat similar to monkeys who have hairs : when it rains , they would hold their heads with their hands , and such a direction of their hairs would be easier for the rain to flow away along their elbows
Most inferior mammals have short life cycles , small heads , simple social behaviors , short gestation periods and large litters of offspring that are underdeveloped at birth .
Most superior mammals , however , have long life cycles , large heads , complicated social behaviors , long gestation periods , and small litters of well developed offspring that already possess a certain level of capability .
Mankind is a perplexing exception .
Elephants are developmentally mature within eleven years of their birth . Their time spent in the womb actually takes up to twenty - two months .
Compared to the speed of development , the human gestation period is clearly too short .
Biologists estimate that if the human gestation period were proportional to the growth period , the baby would still have to spend another seven months to one year in the womb
Following right after the Thanksgiving Day , the year - end shopping season kicked off in the US .
While various kinds of stores are crowded with people , the main shopping and auction websites have also ushered in a large number of visitors for online inquiries and shopping , with hit rates , traffic volume , and sales at these websites dramatically increased because of this .

I had a very lonely childhood because I was the only child in the family , and most of my playmates in the neighborhood had moved to the cities .
Life , like that small river in front of my home , flowed quietly without the slightest ripple .
The year when I was eight , we also moved to live on a street in the center of a small town .
In a flash , I was twelve and attending a local middle school that had a bad reputation .
Actually I graduated from elementary school with very good grades , but because my parents were not well connected , I was rejected by the best one , No. 1 Middle School . I was somewhat despondent .
Let alone that getting oneself a western diploma will make getting a good job easier in the future . Even old dad and mom making a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good !
It seems that once they are sent overseas , nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return .
Wrong ! With a huge chunk of cash spent , the frightening thing is that the payoff falls far short of expectations .
What I have experienced myself or , even more , what I have seen are the countless who have given up their studies year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sold their souls and even those who lost their lives .
Overseas study is a splendid term , but in return it demands youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .
What was Saddam prosecuted for ?

The intimidation that Russia had inflicted on Ukraine is still remembered with a tinge of fear by some European brother - like countries .
First - hand experience is more authoritative than any smooth talk .
Why do humans want to raise offspring ,
This is voiced from the perspective of natural human instinct . Yet from the perspective of human socialization , people in different historical periods saw things differently ,
But when the retirement system in a society has gradually been established , this opinion no longer holds ,
Raising a child is a great hassle ,
A mother has to go through various kinds of pregnancy - related discomfort during pregnancy ,
During delivery , it takes a lot of time and energy if it is a natural birth ,
Sometimes she might suffer a cut on her belly .
What are they doing this for .
Of course , according to the opinion of mainstream economists , these women can only be great fools .
In terms of the gap between the poor and the rich , it is much wider in China than in the US ,
A government employee in the US makes 50,000 US dollars a year , and working class people like waiters can also make 30,000 US dollars . Taxi drivers make even more . Yet in China , a government employee makes 50,000 RMB , and a waiter can only make about 10,000 RMB .
It is an appropriately democratic process that also reflects the independence of the judiciary .
Of course , democracy should be expanded further in the future .
However , abroad , such as in the US , it is administrative bodies and parties that do the nominating . The judiciary has no nominating power at all .
When US President Bush proposed a candidate for supreme court judge , he first nominated his own female secretary .
These in fact are all balances in the democratic system .
For any country that has the same finance system as that in China , it is just a bit more democratic in China .
After the establishment of new China , and in view of the two facets of the Chinese national bourgeoisie , who exploiting the workers to make a profit on one hand , and supporting the constitution as well as accepting socialist transformation on the other , the Chinese Communist Party formulated a policy to use , restrict , and transform capitalist industries and businesses ,
We have bought off a social class , and eliminated a private ownership system ,
Where can they go to get the money ?
This month Jiangxi Province increased pension payments to the retirees , but all the indispensable living costs that a person needs to pay for have started to rise accordingly in the markets .
Even for those laid - off workers who can find work , are private companies going to give them higher wages ?
And how are those who can not find jobs going to make a living ?
Has the government thought about this ?
Long ago , his life was proven to be all for world peace , all for the people having peaceful and happy lives .
Chairman Mao was in charge of all the power that governed China . From beginning to end , all the power to control everything was obtained for the people and used for the people .
In addition , history and facts from the past and the present , from home and abroad , also attest that only his voice in his late years could shake China , and could shake the world .
Yet , in terms of substance , what did he eat ? What kinds of things did he use ?
During an interview by the First Financial Daily yesterday , Marketing Department Manager Lin of the Xinliang Group , a grain and oil processing company in Henan , said that this year has been different from past years in that it has been influenced by market stabilization purchases .

All this electronic waste , if not recycled and treated properly , will all become main pollutants of the future environment and will have enormous effects on the development of the economic society .
At present , the recycling and treatment of electronic trash in our country are in a situation in which they are suffering from problems both at home and abroad . Not only a large amount of electronic trash is generated at home each year , an invasion of foreign electronic trash is also encountered .
Experts told the writer that most materials of electronic trash contain harmful substances such as lead , mercury , tin , cadmium , and others .
If not properly treated , these substances will bring serious pollution to the environment .
The disposal is in a state of supervision vacuum , and it really hurts to think that the large amount of electronic trash in our country is in a state of supervision vacuum .
When , in one period , productivity develops to a certain level and productivity per person reaches an utmost , population , territory , and resources then play a decisive role .

We ought to acknowledge that within the limits of a specific time , one can find things of positive significance in many events in the history .
But take note , these things of positive significance are restricted by the premise of specific time .
Extending these positive significances beyond that premise is totally meaningless .
If it is not nonsense or for some ulterior motive , then we probably have to say that society really has significantly regressed .
Does such a grown - up really keep turning back as he lives on ?
Regarding this as fine , but perhaps a different explanation is that society has not regressed , but just that there are some people who have not progressed ,

A friend once told me that his classmate who had three years of driving experience in mainland China had to take the road test seven times before he finally passed it in the US .

In another attack , gunmen shot at the Iraqi Ministry of Health , and security forces returned fire .
Although lacking enough evidence to show who poisoned Alexander Litvinenko , a former Russian spy still under emergency treatment in a London hospital , it is no surprise that everyone immediately suspected the Russian government and President Putin .
Many people in the West had believed that this poor former Russian special agent would probably get assassinated .
Who believes it ?
How really nice it would be if Putin said some similar words after investigating the assassination of journalist Anna Politkovskaya behind her own home door .
This was recently disclosed by Brazilian investigators .
That is the reality of this world .
Although the distribution system of the new legislative power in Iraq had generally taken care of the interests of all parties , and found a relatively reasonable balance point among all ethnic groups and sects -- otherwise a management committee , the interim constitution , and the current interim government would not have been successfully generated -- this does not mean that there were no contradictions among them .
From an internal point of view , Shiites and Kurds tend to see eye to eye on the political and economic benefits , and Iraqi politics had almost become the arena of these two factions ,
Although under the balance of interests some of Sunni political figures were involved in politics , what the Sunni radical groups were most concerned about was that the Shiites would turn around and suppress them in the future .
Upon hearing this I felt that if a regular statue is being provided for paying respects , then what positive effect does painting it again with a layer of gold have ?
But that is not to say that Mao had stepped down from the altar .
The ubiquitous Mao - related glitz and graffiti have demonstrated this point .
I believe that the vast majority of people of any era in history would identify with the misery that leader worship has caused for society and the common people .
From ancient times , a unique characteristic of mankind has been idol - worship .
But for the Chinese , following the birth of Confucian ethics , the object of worship has often not been those unfathomable spirits , but rather living and breathing mortals who have been deified .
It can send information obtained back to ground control in real time using a data link . It can also allow war zone headquarters or grass - roots units to access the results of UAV reconnaissance in real time .
Because of its feature of a capacity for extended patrol flights , depending on the different natures of tasks , it can also be used as an airborne communications relay station .
For civilian purposes , it can be used for search and rescue missions , locating sunken vessels or vehicles involved in accidents .
Since then , Arafat had appeared on the international political stage as a symbol of the Palestinian nation .
The Sunni and Shiite factions have quickly competed to blame each other , making this shocking massacre , which no one will admit , seem even more horrific .
Perhaps the summit that Iran , Iraq and Syria are planning is their move to seek for self - salvation .
There came the news of an explosion at Moscow University . No one was hurt , but it was a serious psychological blow .
The assassination of the Lebanese Minister of Industry has triggered off angry protests from supporters , plunging Lebanon into yet another precarious situation .
At this moment , the real murderer is probably tittering , but the world has clearly seen that any one of the regimes of Lebanese and Iraqi is more fragile than the other .
And the people believed that .
Fortunately President Hu was magnanimous enough not to take it to heart , and gave him the honor of a 15 - minute meeting .
The Rwandan government has resolutely denied the charge , while the international community has likewise not come to any conclusion regarding the affair . It is simply that the families of the French flight crew have brought the case to the court in France when the former president was killed and thus , that judge and the government want to hold their own law over the heads of others .
And this even resulted in the international media closely chasing Hu in his footsteps as he made this trip on his subsequent trips to Laos , India , and Pakistan .
Then why do I still like Inter Milan ?
Why is there only the blue and blacks in my heart ?
As a result , I started to pay more attention to this soccer team
More than half of the UEFA Champions League games have already taken place , and basically many strong teams are guaranteed access to the elimination series .
With the absence of these four players , it is estimated that Internazionale Milan might be significantly affected .
If they can not score three points in this match , their mission of acquiring the championship basically comes to an end .
But for North Korean athletes , although every one of them looks very skinny , their energy is no less than that of our athletes , who are provided with three scientifically formulated meals a day .
Of course the soccer ball is round , and anything is possible , but to be able to excel under such repression is almost an impossible mission .
I have been thinking about what makes North Korean athletes so full of energy ,
Though each of them looks sallow , when in a real fight , let alone China , they are even no less strong -LRB- physically -RRB- than the European teams .
We lost this game with no complaints .
The IOC warriors return to our motherland with hope .
The east and south slopes of Changbai Mountain are both on the North Korean side of the boundary , if you want to see lake Tianchi , you have to cross the border .
I prayed silently
Time went by minute after minute . When the North Korean soldiers finally let us cross over , we were too excited to express how we felt .
Furthermore , we frequently see theoretical articles saying that the arrival of foreign - funded banks will lead to domestic banks suffering a massive loss of trained personnel because of the wage and benefit issue .
The people who have worked in domestic banks so long will not be in the ranks of those welcomed unless they are extremely specific high - level personnel with customer resources .
My wife job - hopped from a Chinese - funded bank to a foreign - funded bank ,
Either in terms of her experience or her ability , my wife is not my match , and most of the time I am her professional teacher .
Her only advantage is her foreign language . After all , she is an English major graduate .
Now that she joined a foreign - funded bank , her position and salary are both higher than mine ,
It is inevitable for foreign - funded banks to deploy a strategy of utilizing local talent . Although there is a lot of recruiting information from foreign - funded banks on the Internet every day , as a matter of fact , the satisfactory candidates that they can find are very few .
